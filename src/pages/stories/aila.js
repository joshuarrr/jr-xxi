      <h1>Aila, The Winged Unicorn</h1>

      <p className="section-title">I: The Day</p>

      <p className="section-title">The Dream</p>

      <p>The young unicorn Aila was dozing in the meadow in the hour past dawn, in the hour before day, when she awoke with a jolt.</p>

      <p>She had been dreaming of the wishing ceremony, and in her dream she had walked down the long aisles past the Minotaur, and around the radiant blue pool where the beloved Siren sisters sang their beautiful harmonies, and then up to the great dais where Osiler the Great Stallion waited, and she stepped her manicured hooves into the divots in the stone that had worn there after eons of similar events, and she froze.</p>

      <p>She knew that she must sing, and she knew the song she must sing &#2013; she&#8217;d been practicing it for the past two months day and night &#2013; but she could not utter a sound. She looked around at the patient elders who stood in a semi-circle behind the Great Stallion nervously. Elsie, her eldest sister was on the far left and she appeared annoyed. Beside her, Odon, her father, dark and grave, and the largest of the unicorns in the room apart from Osiler. Then came her older cousins, Liba and Pico, and her aunts, and her uncles, and well, everyone. And on her far right-hoof, her mother, Eranor, slender and tall, and purely white with stunning green eyes. Eranor nodded her onward when their eyes met, and that slight nudge broke Aila from her trepidatious trance.</p>

      <p>She briefly collected her thoughts and recalled the words that laid out her wish. Words that in the human&#8217;s language would translate to falling in love with a handsome tall stallion and raising beautiful and kind foals. It was what nearly every young unicorn maiden had wished for, for several eons. But when she set herself and opened her mouth, her breath came out, but Aila found that she could not make a sound.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Restoration</p>

      <p>She bolted upright which frightened Squalmy, her bunny friend who had been sleeping at her side for warmth, and he darted into the forest through the tall reeds. Three butterflies flitted up into the morning air, and one flitted right past her eyelashes and she flicked her tail harmlessly in mock annoyance.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh jee,&#8221; she neighed aloud, &#8220;Today <em>is</em> the wishing ceremony!&#8221;</p>

      <p>She hopped a few times, kicking the leftover sleep out of her haunches, and sang out a long neigh, both to test out her voice and to express her joy to her friends in the meadow. The wishing ceremony was only the most important day in a young unicorn&#8217;s life, and she&#8217;d been waiting for it and dreaming about it for all of her 100 years. Well, to be fair she&#8217;d only been aware of it for 99 1/2 years, so that would be a more accurate number if you&#8217;re particular about such things. But as she bounded towards the endless golden fields of Naranthal where the elders would surely be gathered, something small troubled the young unicorn. She&#8217;d never had a <em>bad</em> dream about the wishing ceremony. Why now, she wondered?</p>

      <p>Naranthal was still slumbering when she arrived, so she grazed a bit on the tall golden grass. Her head was full of the events to come later in the day. The namings, the blinding, the dream casting, and finally her wishing. She was excited with anticipation for her cousin Liba&#8217;s new foal who had turned twenty in the fall and was to be given his name today. Aila had always called him Jialy, but many of the other unicorn&#8217;s names for him were equally splendid. And she was excited for her uncle Tabor who was to be blinded for the year so that he could lead the herd to the best pastures - it was a special honor reserved for the eldest and wisest. And of course her mother, Eranor, would be casting dreams for them this year, as it was the fourth convergence of the three important equine planets, and that meant that she, Aila, would be in charge of caring for her dam when the ceremonies and festivities were over. Which meant that she would have to graze even more than usual today if her horn was to have enough energy to share! It was going to be a big day!</p>

      <p>She was bodiless in her thoughts a sprightly red fox came bounding out of the forest into the tall grass excitedly.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh! Aila, Aila! Come quick! Follow me! It&#8217;s trouble!&#8221; he cried.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What is it, Fisko, what&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; She asked.</p>

      <p>She didn&#8217;t in fact mouth those words, though, because, as you may know, horses and unicorns can&#8217;t speak. We can whinny, and neigh, and snort, and huff, and groan, and grunt, and sigh, and squeal, and sing, and bray, and roar&#8230; and okay, we can make a whole sweep of sounds, but we certainly don&#8217;t <em>talk</em>. No, instead, Aila thought her thoughts, and <em>sent</em> them. But the effect was the same, so what&#8217;s the difference?</p>

      <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Landry and Squalmy! Hurry!&#8221; The fox urged.</p>

      <p>Aila complied and followed Fisko into the woods full of her friends Cedar, and Oak, and Douglas, and Creek, and Slug, and Beetle, and Fern, and Bramble, and Ivy, and&#8230; I&#8217;m doing it again, aren&#8217;t I. I&#8217;ll try to be more concise. She followed the fox into the woods, and though Fisko was fast, she was untroubled by keeping up. She was a unicorn and if she wanted she could run super, super, super fast. But she stayed behind Fisko to see what the trouble was.</p>

      <p>Landry was a bunny she had known for many summers, and when she saw his body flat on the ground and motionless, she whinnied in shock.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened to him!?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Well, him and Squalmy were hopping together, and each was trying to out-hop the other, and that&#8217;s when I saw them and I laughed because they were about to hop themselves into the mud! And it&#8217;s still funny, and if Landry wasn&#8217;t fallen I&#8217;d laugh again right now, because Squalmy did hop right into the mud, and when it was Landry&#8217;s turn to hop next, he didn&#8217;t! And so Squalmy hopped on out and thumped Landry in the ear and then Landry kicked Squalmy back and then they traded hops again but on each other&#8217;s heads. And they were real upset with each other, too, and then they traded such very not nice words with each other, and then Squalmy hopped off towards the brook, and Landry tried to hop away too but when he jumped up into the air he just sort of froze, and then fell, and he&#8217;s still here where he fell on the ground, right here&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh Landry, you poor poor thing!&#8221; Thought the unicorn.</p>

      <p>Aila bent her nose down to the ground, where her friend Landry lay motionless, and she nudged his furry body with her snout, and she was filled with a tremendous sadness. A tear rose in her eye. And that tear rolled down her cheek, and it rolled into the air beneath her cheek, and the tear had then decided to make its way in a direct path to the forest floor when it was pierced by the sharpest thing in the world: a unicorn horn.</p>

      <p>The tear exploded into a colorful display. Purple, and pink. and red, and orange, and green, and teal, and blue, and a thousand other colors that only unicorns can see erupted from the spot where there was once a droplet of unicorn eye water. And it flashed out in a great cloud that disappeared almost instantly. But, when it was done, Aila&#8217;s horn had retained some of the swirling colors, and it glowed warmly in the forest shade.</p>

      <p>What happened next both startled and amazed Fisko and the forest of friends surrounding Aila and the rabbit. She sharply thrust her horn into his side and picked him up a few inches off the ground. And his body stretched out and his eyes went wide. If you were watching closely you would have noticed the color moving from Aila&#8217;s horn in a spiral down into Landry&#8217;s body, and if you were watching really close you might have noticed that the color of his fur changed from brown to slightly <em>more</em> brown. If you were here to see it, that is.</p>

      <p>When she lifted her head, Aila looked down at her friend, who blinked his eyes three times in quick succession, and then scratched his right ear vigorously with his right foot.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh Aila! You saved poor Landry! I knew you could do it!! Hahaha!!!!&#8221; And with that, Fisko the fox leapt over a log and out of sight.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Mister Landry,&#8221; Aila looked down at the rabbit. &#8220;You will make haste to apologize to my friend Mister Squalmy, now, won&#8217;t you? I believe he owes you one as well. I believe both of your feelings were hurt today.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am, absolutely I will. And thank you ma&#8217;am, I don&#8217;t know what happened, but I feel.. I feel great!!&#8221; And Landry bounded off.</p>

      <p>Aila was left alone in the forest. And even if you were here you wouldn&#8217;t have noticed this: the quiet unicorn closed her eyes and sighed and then she swallowed, and for a moment she felt as sad and empty as a unicorn could possibly feel, as though she had swallowed a tiny bite of death.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Morning</p>

      <p>The moment passed and she found her joy as she jumped over a muddy patch on her way back to the others. Aila loved to jump, and she did so merrily several times on her way. And she saw a lovely patch of dark green clover which she snacked on momentarily, which whet her appetite for a more substantial grazing.</p>

      <p>When she returned to the fields of Naranthal the other unicorns were mostly all still asleep, and that was fine by her. She had an empty belly to tend! And she grazed and grazed, and when she was full she ate some more because she knew she would need her energy later.</p>

      <p>Liba was among the first to rise and when she saw Aila she made her way over and bowed customarily.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Gracious morning to you, young filly, how are you enjoying this day so far?&#8221; Liba inquired.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Today has been grand. I am excited, of course, about the ceremonies. I restored Landry again, and that left me a bit cold, but I&#8217;ve warmed myself on this delicious grass and my heart is full again. And you, Liba, are you happy today? Are you excited to find Jialy&#8217;s true name?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am&#8221;, Liba emoted, but she looked aside at the rolling hills. &#8220;I am just nervous because Levnis feels strongly that the foal&#8217;s name will be Ogok, and as you know I would much prefer Ansil. But of course it isn&#8217;t up to me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am sure that Jialy will love his name no matter what it turns out to be!&#8221;, Aila encouraged.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am sure. But Ogok!?&#8221; Liba scoffed, &#8220;I&#8217;d cry&#8221;.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Surely not, Liba! You will find joy in his name because it is his true sound. You only fear this name because you do not believe it is correct. But if it comes to be, you will know, and your love will cover this fear. You know this!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; she replied &#8220;but still, Ogok the Great!?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I admit that it sounds&#8230; a bit silly.&#8221;</p>

      <p>And they both laughed, and they grazed, and Liba disturbed a sleeping Jay which she chased playfully for a bit, and Aila discovered a bit of golden clover, and thought to herself, &#8220;What a wonderful day this is turning out to be!&#8221;</p>

      <p>While she grazed, she thought longingly of her wish. She had of course been friends with the stallions of her herd for, well, for forever. But to truly love.. that must be the best feeling in the world, she thought. &#8216;I bet it is magical. And my stallion will be the tallest in the herd, even taller than Odon or Osiler. He&#8217;ll be all black, but with a hint of auburn that flashes in the sunlight, and he will be kind and powerful, and we will make a thousand foals.&#8217; And her heart was aflutter, as she grazed and fantasized about her wish.</p>

      <p>But a distant reservation disturbed her reveries. Though it was unclear what, something pulled on her, nagged her, and her dreaming dissolved. And she paused and looked around at the field, and at the rolling hills, and her friend the bee buzzing by, and the forest, and the rousing herd of beautiful rising unicorns, and she took a deep breath, and she cantered off to make her preparations for the day.</p>


      <p className="section-title">II: The Ceremony</p>

      <p className="section-title">The Namings</p>

      <p>There were to be four namings that day, and they came first so that the newest named could participate in the rest of the ceremonies. Names are critical to unicorns, for they serve to focus of all their magical energy. Without a name, a unicorn can run fast, but not super super super fast. And they can light their horns in a marvelous display, but they cannot channel that energy into acts of intention. They can bless, and they can send thoughts, but they cannot bless an individual creature, and they cannot project their thoughts as more than subtle hints. They can heal, but they cannot revive, and so for that reason, they are cared for and protected by the entire herd, and they are thought of as children without true individualism. But all that changes with the passage of the naming ceremony.</p>

      <p>The foal whom Aila called Jialy was last to receive his name that day. Aila&#8217;s names for the others were Morsha, Esper, and Theolin. Morsha was a fine golden brown young mare, with a tremendously long blonde mane. Aila cared greatly for her as her dam was Aila&#8217;s aunt Rostly. Aila loved all of her herd &#2013; it was her family after all &#2013; but she was especially friendly with Liba.</p>

      <p>Liba had a rebellious streak in her spirit that was matched by a jagged red stripe down her golden right flank. On several occasions, Aila had joined Liba on long walks far away from the herd, and they talked by opening and sharing their hearts and swirling their unformed thoughts together.</p>

      <p>Once they had even brazenly approached the gates to the other realms together, and though Aila was quite apprehensive about it, they put their noses through the distorted, swirling, images and peered into the world of The Men. They only peeked through for a moment, but what they saw confounded Aila and Liba both. For days Aila replayed disjointed scenes of Men and things that made little sense to her, but Liba was unbothered by such thoughts. Aila&#8217;s curiosity festered, and one day she has brought it to Liba, but Liba said only that there was no need to worry themselves about the lives of Men, that they were trivial and simple, and perhaps she should have never taken Aila there. And they never did go back there together, but they did maintain a habit of going on long adventures making friends with all the beasts of their world. And though Liba never went back to the gates, Aila one day would.</p>

      <p>At sundown, Morsha and the three others to be named approached the curved trees that marked the entrance to the Minotaur&#8217;s maze with the rest of the herd at their backs. Their bodies together were striking in the waning light. Morsha was bright gold; Esper wore dappled blue; Theolin was in white with auburn forelegs, tail, and mane; and of course Jialy was wearing his shaggy dark brown coat. In the waning light of the sun and the tinge of light from the moons their four hides each had a distinct glow about them, while in collective they simply shone.</p>

      <p>From the shadows of the two great curved trees at the edge of the forest emerged Osiler. Without delay he approached the four foals and when within a few feet, he rose on his hind legs and stomped forcibly down with his front hooves. There was a great thunderous sound, and a cloud of mist arose at his feet that quickly evaporated revealing a fresh spring of pure crystalline water.</p>

      <p>&#8220;First.&#8221; He boomed. And he looked down to Morsha. Because he was the Great Stallion he did not have a name for her.</p>

      <p>Nervous but excited, Morsha stepped forward into the pool. It glowed gently where her hooves touched, but she only sank in a few inches. She took two more small steps towards the Great Stallion and looked shyly up at him.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; Osiler cried.</p>

      <p>The rest of the herd, about 27 unicorns in total, were gathered behind the namelings in a wide arc. The first to call out was Morsha&#8217;s dam, Rostly. She stepped forward, and responded, &#8220;Tinip!&#8221;</p>

      <p>And from the horn of the unicorn standing in the pool came a strong but gentle blue light. And Rostly stepped back.</p>

      <p>Her sire, Trally, stepped forth. &#8220;Ioni!&#8221; He cried.</p>

      <p>And the horn of the unicorn emitted a soft orange glow.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Kalee!&#8221; Cried Liba. And the horn glowed somewhat brighter orange.</p>

      <p>Aila stepped forward to take her turn. &#8220;Morsha!&#8221; She cried. And the horn glowed a wonderful bright pink. It was the brightest yet, and she stepped back to her place hopefully.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Kelve!&#8221; Cried Pico, the young mare&#8217;s uncle. The horn shone a pale green, and dimmed considerably.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Tessa!&#8221; Cried another.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Sendry!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Eva!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Leston!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Shail!&#8221;</p>

      <p>And after a long silence, and after the light from her horn had faded, she looked up at Osiler with a newfound poise and replied, &#8220;My name is Morsha.&#8221;</p>

      <p>And with that, the horn on every unicorn there in the fledgling darkness by the forest cast a marvelous explosion of bright pink light, and Morsha&#8217;s horn was brightest of all.</p>

      <p>When the pink light dimmed, Osiler bowed his head, and Morsha trotted back to join the row of unicorns behind her.</p>

      <p>Breglin and Thorsh&#8217;s names were chosen in a similar fashion, and while Aila&#8217;s name Esper made a strong showing, she was joyed to learn Breglin&#8217;s true name.</p>

      <p>When Jialy stepped into the spring, Liba impetuously stepped forward. And when Osiler demanded &#8220;What is your name?&#8221;, Liba immediately cried out &#8220;Ansil!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Jialy&#8217;s horn intensely glowed a miraculous dark blue. And as quick as that, Jialy replied &#8220;My name is Ansil&#8221;, and the forest turned blue with the light of the unicorns.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Blinding</p>

      <p>&#8220;Now Tabor will step forward.&#8221; Demanded Osiler. And Tabor did.</p>

      <p>&#8220;We know Tabor, all of us. And we know his gentle heart and wise insight. We all know Tabor&#8217;s joyful yellow song, and we all know the forest he tends, as it is verdant and lively and home to many friends. Not all know of Tabor&#8217;s sacrifice, but today I will inform you. Three moons past, a group of 4 of The Men came through the gates. These Men were not like the ones we have met before, but they were angry and hostile and they meant us harm. Harm! They had long knives as sharp as our horns, but they had no magic. Tabor was able to drive these Men back through the gates, and he sealed it from passage from their dominion for one hundred years as is custom. But he paid a tax, Unicorns. He paid a tax that we must all bear, for one Men he made fall with his horn, and for that life his color has dimmed. A small matter, though, for today it will replenish.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Unicorns rejoice, for Tabor has been chosen, and we will now perform the blinding!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Osiler raised his right hoof, and he splashed it down heavily into the spring. And out of a new mist, a translucent show of luminescence in the form of a unicorn became partway visible. This was Elphren, the currently blinded! And Elphren turned to face Tabor, and with two graceful motions he thrust his intangible horn into Tabor&#8217;s eyes. As he did this, wispy threads of light flew away from his form and into Tabor&#8217;s. And as that was taking place, Elphren became solid. When the spectacle was over, Elphren stood full-bodied facing a semi-transparent memory of Tabor. And on cue, the entire herd of unicorns surrounding the two lowered their heads, and from their horns came their individual colors, and those colors went into Tabor&#8217;s body and his body flashed a bright white light, and he was gone.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Dream Casting</p>

      <p>When the light had faded, and they were cloaked in darkness, Osiler continued. &#8220;This Convergence is the fourth alignment all three Equis Planets since the splitting of the realms. As such, it is a great honor bestowed upon Eranor to cast new dreams. Tonight marks one year since our last casting, and we have been blessed by the wonderful dreams cast by Shelse; may we all take a moment now to send her our gratitude.&#8221;</p>

      <p>And there was a smattering of snickers and a number of neighs and a whinny, and Shelse glowed bright and demurely.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Eranor, please begin.&#8221;</p>

      <p>And the herd watched stoically as Eranor stepped forward into the spring.</p>

      <p>Eranor spoke. &#8220;Thank you, Osiler, and thank you all for this privilege. I have put special attention into my efforts this year for each of you. May these dreams bring you joy.&#8221;</p>

      <p>With that, she reared up onto her hind legs, and when she came crashing down, a great cloud of vapor formed around her. From inside the mist, a turbulent cyclone formed from Eranor&#8217;s horn, and with a terrific gesture, Eranor rose again to her hind legs and the whirlwind shot up into the sky. Great clouds formed, magically illuminated, and they soon filled the sky. And as quickly as it had begun, it was over, and Eranor was unveiled in the spring facing Osiler again but small wisps of dream cloud vapor clung to her head and horn.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Wishing</p>

      <p>All the unicorns cheered, and a warm rush of energy came over them. But Aila, who had seen hundreds of these ceremonies before, felt a nagging tug. She tried to brush it away with the flick of her tail, but it persisted, and she realized that she was feeling something strange. It was excitement, for her wishing was nearly upon her, but it was another feeling too &#2013; one she was unaccustomed to. She was… afraid. But what of? She would finally make her wish, and she would love, and mate! This was meant to be a good thing, right? Why was she afraid? She knew her wishing song, and she&#8217;d been singing all day so she knew her voice works. And she knew what she wanted! Didn&#8217;t she?</p>

      <p>And there it was. Doubt. Aila, deep in her thoughts, finally realized that she wasn&#8217;t sure that what she wanted was actually what she wanted. Mating a tall fine stallion sounded great. But surely there were other options! What else could they be? Why was she only now considering this? What had happened to her over the past months and years? She felt like she had been under a spell, and now here she was, confounded and instead of being overjoyed she was panicked. She inadvertently snorted at herself, and her neighbor, Kylie, looked over at her inquisitively. And she asked &#8220;What?&#8221;, and Aila, embarrassed, replied, &#8220;Nothing, just excited.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Kylie and Aila had been friends their whole lives - why was she hiding herself from her now? The panic was rising! Why couldn&#8217;t she just say that she was afraid she had decided upon the wrong wish? Wait, the wrong wish?! Was is really the wrong wish? Wasn&#8217;t this what every mare wishes for? But in her heart she knew that it wasn&#8217;t what she wanted. She wanted something else.. but what was it? She had always loved her long adventures with Liba most of all. Maybe that was it. Aila was getting frantic. Maybe what was it? Adventure? She already had that! And she thought about her moments looking into the other realms.. it was forbidden but she would love to see them! And Aila felt a warm soothing sensation and she knew that she had changed her mind.</p>

      <p>&#8220;And now, we will adjourn temporarily, as we make our way to the Wishing Stage.&#8221; Commanded Osiler, the Great Stallion. His horn flashed a dark purple light that reflected eerily off his smooth dark features.</p>

      <p>&#8220;We have one Wish Maker, tonight. Aila, you will remain here. Wait for your shooting star to arrive, then do not tarry.&#8221;</p>

      <p>And he led the herd through the two curved trees and back into the darkness beyond, and soon Aila was alone.</p>


      <p className="section-title">Aila&#8217;s Star</p>

      <p>She waited patiently. As she gazed up at the stars, her thoughts went back to that day when she and her cousin Liba had peeked through the gates to the world of The Men. The Men were an almost mythical race, far removed from everyday Unicorn life. They were known to be small, upright beings, of an unpredictable nature. But yes, they were real, and on occasion they had been known to find their way here to our realm.</p>

      <p>The first of The Men to come through the gates were sensitive and easily startled, the old stories told. And they were artists, and they spoke to the Unicorns with pictures that they drew in the ground with sticks. The Unicorns at the time thought them to be kind and inquisitive and rather unsophisticated. When the leader of that first party of The Men drew a crude depiction of the three of them and the unicorn they were speaking to, Brax (it is told) whinnied and said to them, &#8220;Yes! That is you, and that is me, together!&#8221; He was amused by the drawing of the obvious, but he couldn&#8217;t possibly have know the full meaning of his own words.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of years later The Men came again. This time there were six members of their herd; they were are all rather small, but two were larger than the rest, two were of medium stalk, and two of them were tiny. The tiny ones were delighted when they saw the herd &#2013; this was not Aila&#8217;s herd, but another (The Zengoli, if you are curious or are keeping track) that grazes far to the north. And it is remembered that the littlest of The Men had the ability to speak to the Unicorns they met! They had little to say, but what they did say pleased those there then. They <em>loved</em> us. And probably because they felt such love from the little The Men, those unicorns became close with the Men. And The Men lived here, in our realm for several years.</p>

      <p>And perhaps it because they were so close to The Men that the falling that occurred was so devastating. For it is told that one Men cast a rope around the mare named Marissella, and he leaped upon her, and he tied her with the rope around the mouth, and although she protested and insisted that he remove himself, he did not, and she therefore dispelled him with her horn. And the other of The Men saw this occur and then <em>he</em> threw rope at her, and so she dispelled the rope. And when he ran into the forest, it is said that Marissella followed, and Bren, her mate saw this and joined her, and they ran super super super fast and caught up with The Men as they reached the abode they had built out of dead trees.</p>

      <p>When the Unicorns arrived, they were curious why The Men had become hostile, and they meant to inquire. Marissella roared out her questions, and then there was a tremendous loud clap of thunder that came from the house, and Bren fell. Marissella cried out in alarm to her herd, and then went to Bren&#8217;s side to revive him, but there was another loud clap and she fell. By the time Thossler the Great Stallion arrived at the house, The Men had cut the horn off of Marissella&#8217;s head, and when Thossler dispelled the other Men, he had cut halfway through Bren&#8217;s horn as well. When the medium sized and littlest of The Men saw the Great Stallion arrive and their large one fall, they shrieked and ran, and the Great Stallion Thossler shepherded them to the gates of the realms, and he forced them back through the Gate of The Men, and he used all the color in his body to seal the gate for a hundred years. Marissella could not be revived, but Thossler&#8217;s last act as Great Stallion of the herd was to revive Bren.</p>

      <p>It is remembered that Bren stayed in that place, by the body of his love, for seven years, until the last traces of her body had been carried away by ants.</p>

      <p>There had been several other times that The Men had visited, but none so impactful as Thossler&#8217;s stand. Unicorns became wary of the little beasts, and whenever The Men came, they would politely insist that they go back whence they came. And that reminded Aila of something that the Great Stallion Osiler had said &#2013; poor Tabor had to dispel a Men! How awful! He would carry that with him for many years, if not the rest of his life. Thankfully the lighting ceremony during his blinding would restore his colors &#2013; next year when he got his eyes back, that is. But what a terror he had suffered. And what exactly had happened!? Osiler said that The Men had come at us with knives!? Whatever for?</p>

      <p>Her own glimpse into the world of The Men had been a cacophony of random images. She had seen immense forests the size of mountains filled with massive rectangular trees, and she had seen a tube filled with rows and rows of The Men sitting and staring at colorful magic squares, and she had seen The Men of all shapes and sizes in huge crowds. And The Men made such noises! Sad noises, happy noises, explosive noises&#8230; noises of every possible size and feeling. She had seen two of The Men walking together, with their arms around each other, but the stopped and put their faces and bodies together as if they wished to become one. And she had seen two of The Men on a platform surrounded by a monstrous room full of them, and the two in the middle were swinging their arms at each other as though they were trying to knock each other over. But the one glimpse she saw that she couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about was of a Men on top of a horse running through the forest. And the thought she couldn&#8217;t help herself from thinking was that the horse was clearly delighted.</p>

      <p>Aila was troubled. And that feeling of being afraid had come back, in a new form. She was tracking down the emotion when she felt a warmth in her horn in the sky to the southeast. And she looked up to see her star flying across the night&#8217;s dark canvas.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Dear Star&#8221;, she thought as she looked over at the tunnel leading into the dark forest. &#8220;What am I to do? I think I want to see the world of The Men, but I&#8217;m so afraid.&#8221;</p>

      <p>When she looked back up to sky it had vanished &#2013; hidden on the other side of the planet.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh, well, I better get this over with.&#8221;</p>

      <p>And she went through the two great oaks that were curved across each other so that they made an archway into the dark forest.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Wishing Ceremony</p>

      <p>Aila walked through the long aisles towards the great hall, where she knew the herd would be waiting. She knew the way well, so there was no risk of her getting lost. Not only had she been coming here for Unicorn Ceremonies for a hundred years, but she used to come here to play with the Minotaur when she was a young filly. Minnow (as she called him) hated it when she would almost let him catch her but then phase though a wall, but Aila loved doing it. Once she sent poor Minnow into such a rage that he fisted his way through the solid stone wall just in time to see her tail flick goodbye as she trotted through to the forest. Of course as she matured she felt bad for the poor bull-headed little beast, and she did what she could to make amends. For instance once she let him get a hold of her tail &#2013; just enough so that he was able to pluck a single strand from her tresses. And to this day he wears that hair around his neck, so she knew they were likely even.</p>

      <p>But today she had serious business, and so she trepidatiously but intently walked through the series of turns and twists of the labyrinth and soon found herself in the great chamber of the Sirens. Ahead, the sisters Thelzie and Mollpe were singing their beautiful harmonies, accompanied by what sounded like a small harp. Their song had no magical effect on her, but Aila tuned in momentarily and was struck with melancholy. The music was soft and mysterious, almost a whisper, and it created a susurrous din throughout the hall that relaxed her spirit. She pushed on, and as she crossed the central bridge over the circular pool, she caught sight of Mollpe twisting through the dark water.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Your song is enchAnderg, Mollpe&#8221;, Aila sent delicately. &#8220;It calms me, and I am grateful.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Mollpe finished singing her current phrase, and she breached the water while arching her body backward through the air and resubmerged.</p>

      <p>Aila continued onward. She came to the great gate that lead out to the Clearing, and paused for the briefest of moments. With a deep breath and a slow exhalation she exited the hall into the night.</p>

      <p>First she passed the namelings. She recognized Flaena and Ry, as they were both on either side of the aisle looking excitedly at her as she passed. And there was Morsha! Whose name she had found! She was filled with a brief but poignant joy. And there were the young stallions Ee and Artax, each looking at her with a cultured indifference but both inwardly hoping to catch her eye.</p>

      <p>She stepped into the center of the clearing and approached the ring of elders. Her hooves fell effortlessly into the divots that had worn into the stone before the great dais. She thought of all the realms &#2013; how many were there? Twelve or a thousand and twelve, she couldn&#8217;t remember at the moment. And she thought about that day she and Liba had peered into the world of The Men. She smiled and looked up at the Dais.</p>

      <p>Osiler the Great Stallion was before her on the podium, standing tall and stately above the rest of the elders. Instead of his typical scowl, he appeared eager and almost happy. Aila scanned the ring of elders behind him. Her sister Elsie was to the far left &#2013; unlike Aila&#8217;s dream she didn&#8217;t appear annoyed at all but actually happy. Her father Odon, Liba, Pico, Trin, Era, Plassiler, Vestra, Sastari, Flamler, Trace, Aeina, Azren, Jal, and finally her lovely mother Eranor, and they were all looking at her with love and expectation.</p>

      <p>Eranor&#8217;s green eyes flashed and Aila heard her gentle urging, &#8220;Go on dear.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila looked down at her beautiful hooves, took a deep breath, looked up directly into the eyes of Osiler and sang out, &#8220;I wish free passage to and from the world of The Men.&#8221;</p>

      <p>There was a long pause then wherein nothing happened. No one moved. No fly flitted a wing. Leaves that were halfway along on their voyage to the ground froze where they were. The Clearing &#2013; a great field encircled by a stand of tall pines and presently occupied by a coterie of Unicorns &#2013; was silent.</p>

      <p>Osiler&#8217;s eager and almost happy expression slowly shifted. First his slack jaw and partially open lips tightened and closed. Then his relaxed ears rotated forward. When his eyes narrowed (and did they turn red?), Aila felt the gravity of her wish. Had she made a terrible misstep? Her heart began to sink as she looked around and saw the same look on her father Odon&#8217;s face.</p>

      <p>Osiler spoke quietly but against the heavy silence his words stood with the weight of the megaliths.</p>

      <p>&#8220;That is forbidden.&#8221;</p>

      <p>At that, Aila filled up with a terrible energy.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Forbidden?&#8221; She asked.</p>

      <p>&#8220;FORBIDDEN!&#8221; Osiler cried.</p>

      <p>His voice echoed though the Siren&#8217;s hall behind them, and around in circles guided by the pines as it ascended to the vastness of the sky in order to boom appropriately.</p>

      <p>Aila both exploded and imploded. Her body was filled with dread. No, Terror. No, maybe it was dread. She had never angered Osiler before, and she had never been <em>yelled at</em> before, and she found a powerful distaste for both. What had she done that was so wrong? Why did he yell so forcefully!? She was agitated - every cell in her body wanted to distance itself from Osiler in its own direction. Aila felt that tension. Her mind&#8217;s eye flashed to Landry rabbit&#8217;s contorted body stretched out while pegged by her horn as she revived him this morning, and she wondered if this is what dying and coming back to life might feel like.</p>

      <p>She again scanned her periphery, seeking solace or comfort from anywhere, anyone. But everyone seemed to be in a similar state of shock. Aila looked back and forth, all around her. She looked up to the sky, following Osiler&#8217;s voice, and saw a crow circling far above. And in the distance she saw some other young Unicorn&#8217;s star racing across the night sky.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Then I wish I had wings so that I might fly away from here.&#8221; Aila sang before nurturing the thought. Even as the words left her mouth she felt the magic conspiring. There was a flurry of sounds now, whinnying and nickering and some gasping and some chattering. She heard Eranor neigh. But all of that was far off in the distance. Aila&#8217;s entire world consisted of herself, the insane wish she had just made, Osiler&#8217;s flummoxed expression, and her incredible desire to be anywhere but where she stood.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Then it is done.&#8221; Voiced Osiler.</p>

      <p>His words broke the spell, and Aila began a new one. She stood up on her hind legs, roared her fiercest roar, and stretched her illustrious wings open wider and wider for all to see.</p>

      <p>And then she flew away.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Dispersing</p>

      <p>The herd stared in amazement as her transfigured form lofted upwards in a gradual spiral until she crested the tips of the pines and was gone. Eranor called out to her to no avail. After the initial shock wore off, there was a chatter of animated voices as scattered members of the herd gave voice to their surprise and amazement. Eranor was distressed. Elsie and Trin comforted her. Osiler stood motionless looking skyward, his focus turned towards Ilo, or maybe Lastri, or possible it was Orthe. It was one of the three equine planets that were ever present in the sky. I think. What he pondered there, where his mind went then none knows. For minutes he stood in silence, and then he left the Clearing through the Siren&#8217;s Hall without another word.</p>

      <p>The ceremony ended in a hushed cacophony.</p>

      <p>The unicorns dispersed. Ee and Artax, the young stallions exchangers impressed and surprised faces with each other. Ee was unabashedly smitten, having always been drawn to Aila&#8217;s free spirit and independence. Artax was intrigued &#2013; Aila&#8217;s wings were impressive and in their way, beautiful &#2013; but he felt uneasy. Being the largest in the herd apart from Osiler and Odon, he had always presumed that Aila would chose him to mate, if not a wish-stallion. Now, his immediate reaction was disappointment &#2013; he knew deep down that he had no desire to sire foals with wings! Ee on the other hand was enchanted, and Artax&#8217;s thoughts comforted him. He realized the oddity of Aila&#8217;s new form but it didn&#8217;t diminish his esteem for her, it increased it.</p>

      <p>Eranor and Trin left the clearing last. Trin stayed close to Eranor&#8217;s flank, comforting her. She was exhausted from the dream making and now she didn&#8217;t know what to think. Her youngest daughter had always been a free spirit, but this was an unexpected event! Eranor had heard Aila&#8217;s song many times over the past few moons &#2013; Why had she not wished for her stallion? And where had she gone! Why did she want to visit the realm of The Men? There were too many unanswered questions, and she was too exhausted to investigate further. She needed rest, and she needed the restorative energy Aila had been cultivating. She hoped she would see her soon as she made her way to her dwelling in the shade of her friend the Sycamore.</p>

      <p>As Eranor crested the hill on the last stretch of her walk home, she saw Aila&#8217;s signature pink glow near the Sycamore. Eranor sighed a deep sigh, and felt a wash of relief. She may have sprouted wings and flown away but at least she remembered her dear mother.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll leave you now&#8221;, Trin said as they drew closer. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure the two of you will have much to discuss and Trace will be glad for companionship this night.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Thank you, Trin, I&#8217;ve appreciated your companionship tonight myself.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Reckoning</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila, you came!&#8221; Eranor sent as she approached the tree and her beautiful pinkish shimmering daughter. Aila&#8217;s coat was white of color, but her color was pink. Her horn, imbued with youth and ripe with magic, was constantly emitting a low level glow that clung to her form and wrapped her body in a subtle charming pink light. Her glow responded to her emotional state, and Aila was currently glowing with a dark, almost red, sheen. And her wings! Tucked in their resting position, Eranor hardly noticed them at first. Now she took a moment to gaze upon her daughter&#8217;s new form. Even in the cover of night, she could distinguish the new shapes and the texture of feathers.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Well aren&#8217;t they just lovely. Come on, let me have a look.&#8221; She demanded.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh! You like them?&#8221; Aila inquired as she slowly unfurled and rose her wingtips wide.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that.&#8221; Eranor grinned. &#8220;I think they&#8217;re just incredible. I might not have chosen them for myself but you have.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes, mother, I have! And I don&#8217;t know why and I don&#8217;t know what to do. And I do love flying! But what have I done!?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know Aila, but it is done, and there is no going back. I&#8217;m sorry you are distressed.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not distressed! I have wings!&#8221; Aila cried.</p>

      <p>In all actuality, she was in fact distressed, she just didn&#8217;t realize it yet. But she would soon.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes, dear. You do. You have an infinite future in front of you to come to terms with that fact. But there&#8217;s nothing that I can do about it right here and now.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I know&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;But there is something that you can do for me.&#8221; Eranor was extremely exhausted, and she lowered her head. &#8220;I am quite tired.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh mother! I forgot your dream casting! You&#8217;re so pale! Let me help you.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Eranor stepped over to her clearing in the tall grass and slowly and carefully lay down. Aila followed, and when her mother was settled she leaned down and tucked her chin to point her horn towards her dam&#8217;s chest. She slowly impaled her horn into her mother&#8217;s side, aiming for the heart. When she could push no further, she closed her eyes and began expelling her energy into her mother&#8217;s body. Where horn pierced hide there was a bright ring of bright pink, and where Aila&#8217;s horn was exposed there was an incredible bright white that lit the eerie scene.</p>

      <p>It took a long time &#2013; Aila had been saving her magic for several weeks now &#2013; but eventually the process was complete. Aila withdrew her horn, and the glow diffused. Eranor was fast asleep, but her color had returned and she was breathing peacefully.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Flight</p>

      <p>Aila grazed nearby until dawn &#2013; that mystical hour before the day had awoken. The grass here was good and substantial, but minty, and Aila had never particularly cared for mint. She grazed, and while restoring her mother&#8217;s depleted magical energy had calmed her, she was still at odds with herself. Why on Earth had she made such an impetuous wish? Why, not even Liba had done anything this crazy, and everyone always said she was the impish one. Well, it appears she was the wild one now. Wings! What stallion would ever want a mare with <em>wings</em>!? What of her friends? Would they treat her differently now? No, what a silly question. <em>Of course they would.</em> This was distressing.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am distressed!&#8221; Aila realized.</p>

      <p>She wanted desperately to talk to Liba, but it would be some time before that was a possibility, and Aila was agitated. Given her options, she decided to go for a fly. She reared up, spread her wings, and when she pushed them down her body went up. And she repeated the process. And it was actually quite easy to get the hang of, now that she knew what it was all about.</p>

      <p>Her first flight had been a bit of an emotional battle. At first it was terrifying, but she was so angry and confused that she didn&#8217;t let it get to her. But now she had time for it to really sink in &#2013; horses were not meant to fly! Countering that was her experience. &#8220;I have already done this, and it worked out fine, so surely it will be fine now&#8221;, she thought as she watched the sycamore tree and mother below shrink smaller and smaller.</p>

      <p>As she rose higher and higher, she started moving forward, which she found almost as easy as thinking it. She just leaned into the direction she wanted to go and her wings did the rest. And then she had the thought to try <em>hopping</em>. Aila loved to hop and jump when she was land bound, so it was a natural instinct. But when she hopped in the air she flew in a dramatic arc hundreds of meters long. It was exhilarating! And so she air hopped for a while, and then she had another though. &#8220;I wonder if I can <em>fly</em> super super super fast!?&#8221; And she tried. And guess what.. ok I know you already guessed it. She could. She <em>could</em> fly super super super fast! And if you were here on the ground to see her flying you would swear it was just a meteorite flying by &#2013; a great sharp pink line drawn across the dark blue sky.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Space Bath</p>

      <p>Aila&#8217;s initial reservations about her wish had for the moment evaporated. She reveled in this new sensation. She rejoiced in her new command over her form through the atmosphere. She was elated &#2013; a feeling she was quite familiar with. When she tired of air hopping and air flying super super super fast (which she called shooting), she tried going as high as she could. She reached the limits of the atmosphere, and went higher still. She entered the blackness of space, and she kept flying, higher and higher towards Ilo, her favorite of the three equine planets. After several minutes of traversing the vast nothingness, she found her mind starting to wander. She thought about her mother, sleeping far below in the tall minty grass. She thought about Liba, and Liba&#8217;s foal Ansil, and she felt a tinge of envy. Would she ever mate now that she was&#8230; this? Surely there was a stallion out there somewhere that would love her despite her&#8230; abnormality. Ee and Artax had both made their interests clear; perhaps one of them would still admire her? She did prefer Ee, though. But Artax was a simple sort and might not care that her foals might be winged, and he might be a fine partner in a pasture-dwelling sort of way. But Ee was a bit more mysterious and unpredictable; Aila had always been curious about him. Wow, her thoughts really were wandering out here among the stars.</p>

      <p>She tucked her wings in a moment, excited to feel the sudden drop of descent, but nothing happened. She floated there, with no resistance whatsoever. For some reason this made her laugh, though she didn&#8217;t know why.</p>

      <p>She let herself drift above the sky until the cold ate away at her reserves of energy; for a long while her mind was blank, and she simply breathed in the light of the stars. When the sun crested the planet below, a tremendous light pummeled her body and consciousness.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Well that was a bit of a rude awakening, wasn&#8217;t it Mr. Sun!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

      <p>She supposed she should make her way back to Naranthal. She had found a new calmness, and was looking forward to seeing Liba and Elsie and all her other friends. What would Squalmy say!</p>

      <p>When she looked down she felt a bit queasy. She could see the entire planet, like a great disk in the sky. She could places where the sun had yet to reach! It must be dawn &#2013; her favorite time of the not yet day &#2013; there where the sun was about to shine.</p>

      <p>As she looked down at the earth so far away, she felt suddenly afraid.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; She thought.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Where is my home?&#8221; She wondered.</p>

      <p>From this height she didn&#8217;t recognize any of the landscape. She should have kept better track of where she was going!</p>

      <p>With no other options, Aila flew down towards the line where sunlight met the darkness, and hoped she would be able to find her way once she was nearer the surface.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Fountain of Youth</p>

      <p>She alighted near a small pond of sparkling clear blue water, in the warm sun of late morning, in a land completely foreign to her. She took several steps into the pond and had a long drink. The water was cool and had a tingly taste on her lips and tongue and at first she thought nothing of it as she had worked up a terrible thirst. But after a moment she paused, and she noticed in her reflection that her subtle pink ambient glow had intensified. There was something special about this water! She took another long drink, and felt her energies restoring. The tingly water was vaguely sweet, and though no longer thirsty she indulged in a third long dose. This was the most delicious pond she&#8217;d ever drank from!</p>

      <p>While lapping at the water greedily, she felt a pair of eyes on her from the trees near the edge of the pond across from her. The pond was only a dozen or so meters across, so when she glanced up she expected to see a friend or visitor, but there was no one. Unicorn eyes are quite good. They are much better than the great eagles at seeing long distances, and much better than the prosimians at seeing in the dark, and they are almost as powerful as the dragonflies at seeing in slow motion. When Aila saw nothing in the woods she did not assume that her eyes were deceiving her; she wondered what invisible presence she detected.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221; She sent her curiosity out into the direction of the presence.</p>

      <p>She heard no reply, and the feeling of being watched subsided, so she bowed down to the water and began drinking again. As soon as she did so, she felt the presence return, and she quickly looked up a bit to the right, and as she did so, she saw a small branch of a magnolia tree move abruptly. She stared in that direction intently, her body perfectly still. Though she could see nothing but the woods there, she felt a life-force there that was almost familiar.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Who are you, friend? You needn&#8217;t hide from me. I am Aila, the winged unicorn, and I mean you no harm.&#8221; Aila&#8217;s curiosity got the better of her.</p>

      <p>There was a brief pause, but then Aila saw a faint yellow glow &#2013; it wasn&#8217;t so much a glow actually, it was more like a network of moving veins of soft yellow in the vague shape of an invisible unicorn.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh Tabor! It&#8217;s you! Thank Ilo, it&#8217;s good to see you here! I have been lost for hours.&#8221; She sent him her thoughts, but she was overflowing with energy. Each word was surrounded by a stream of powerful pink magic.</p>

      <p>Tabor&#8217;s glow intensified momentarily, and Aila could almost see his complete form. He quickly moved his head in a direction away from the pond.&quot;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Do you want me to follow you?&#8221;</p>

      <p>At that, Tabor turned away and trotted slowly away.</p>

      <p>It was not known to Aila that the blinded could make themselves visible to a unicorn, and it was unheard of that a blinded would lead an individual, but Aila loved and trusted her uncle, and he was after all the blinded &#2013; his purpose now was to lead the herd!</p>

      <p>&#8220;I will follow!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila flapped her wings gently for effect, and she skittered up and across the surface of the pool and was quickly close behind.</p>

      <p>He led her to the south; through a grove of blooming pink magnolia trees that caused Aila&#8217;s heart to flutter; up a steep hillside completely overgrown with ivy and tall pine trees that dripped lichen; across a great terrain of tall grasses and shrubs where Aila lost sight of Tabor and for a long while followed a nearly invisible trail of stamped grass; and into a sunken vale of mysterious cypress trees. This was a protracted sojourn Tabor was leading her on. Aila had plenty of time to wonder where he was leading her, and why, which was the more intriguing though less answerable question.</p>

      <p>When they reached the cypress vale, Aila felt a slight familiarity. These were interesting trees, and she had long ago made friends with their striated boles that showed off their powerful root structures. Aila remembered them fondly from her adventures with Liba - there were many near the gates of the realms that they had visited.</p>

      <p>&#8220;The gates!&#8221; She cried, as she realized where they were.</p>

      <p>Tabor stopped a moment, and his yellow glow flared briefly before he continued onward.</p>

      <p>&#8220;But why would you bring me here, Tabor?&#8221; Perhaps this was just the most direct path to Naranthal. Surely Tabor was just helping her find her way home.</p>

      <p>They proceeded deeper into the vale, through a curvy trail, and were soon at the clearing where large standing stones marked the four directions around the grassy hill. Tabor led her not to the southern stone as she expected as she knew the gates were north of Naranthal, but in a direct path up the hill towards the gates.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Tabor, where are you taking me?&#8221; Aila demanded, though she knew he could not answer.</p>

      <p>This time he did not respond. His yellow glow was intensifying, and when they arrived at the ring of stone ground that encircled the swirling windows Aila could again clearly see his magical form of swirling yellow lines. He led her around to the easternmost side of the circular path, and stopped facing the portal to the west.</p>

      <p>Aila approached beside him, her mind abuzz. This was the gate to the realm of The Men.</p>

      <p>&#8220;But Tabor, I don&#8217;t understand. I have been here before, and I have even looked through this gate. But Oslier said it is forbidden! Why have you brought me here?&#8221;</p>

      <p>He stood motionless, facing the gate. Aila could not read his thoughts and she was unnerved. She was used to fully understanding the thoughts and emotions of her friends and companions. She knew Tabor fairly well, and trusted him implicitly. Her mother, Eranor, had always been close with her older brother, and though Aila had not interacted with Tabor frequently of late, he was family. Long ago, for years after her naming, Tabor would still call her Joili &#2013; his name for her before her naming &#2013; as a sort of tease, and Aila would lovingly rebuke him for that. Now, she wished desperately to hear his voice. Instead, the blind ghostly indication of him stood motionless staring into the portal of The Men. What did he want her to do? Should she look through? Should she <em>go</em> through?</p>

      <p>Why was this happening? The last day&#8217;s cycle left Aila reeling. She had wished to go to the land of The Men, and been denied. She had wished for wings, and flown! She restored her mother&#8217;s magical energy. She flew to the edge of the world and halfway to Ilo! And she had gotten lost, and then drank from a miraculous pond that saturated her with magic energy. She had found Tabor! That alone was a feat worth sharing with the herd - it was a revelation to her that it was even possible! And now she was being faced with an epic conundrum. What was she supposed to do?</p>

      <p>As if on cue, Tabor looked over at Aila and his eyes glowed thick with veins of magical yellow energy. He then took several paces backwards, bowed his head slightly downwards, and lurched forward spanning the gap between himself and the portal in a single bound before leaping up and towards the portal, where he vanished.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Tabor!&#8221; It was all she could exclaim before he was gone.</p>

      <p>Aila snorted, and pawed at the ground with her fore-hooves. It was clear that he wanted her to go through the portal. A large part of her wanted to! What was on the other side? Where would she find herself if she went? Would she finally meet The Men? Why was Tabor urging her here? <em>What did he know?</em></p>

      <p>She was filled with excitement at the thought of adventuring out of her realm, and the magic bristled within her. The truth is, she wanted to go, she just wished she understood why this was happening.</p>

      <p>A thought came to her then. It was a saying that Tabor used long ago when Aila was young. One afternoon while walking with him and her mother, she had become afraid to leap across a wide stream, and he said to her ambivalently from the other side, <em>&#8220;If not now, then maybe never!&#8221;</em> It had peeved her at the time; she wasn&#8217;t sure she would make it across, and she did not want to land in the rocky water. But she thought about never being able to do it and it gave her the courage she needed. Almost! She did land in the rocks and made a great splash, but she and Tabor and Eranor had a great laugh. She stored it with her most cherished memories of her youth.</p>

      <p>She shuffled over to where Tabor had last stood, and gazed into the opalescent portal, and steeled herself.</p>

      <p>&#8220;If not now, then maybe never,&#8221; she said out loud to herself. With that, she spread her wings out wide and forward and leapt into the world of The Men.</p>



      <p className="section-title">III: The World of Men</p>

      <p className="section-title">The Mirror</p>

      <p>She landed where she least expected, which was exactly where she would have landed if she had jumped through nothing. She was in the middle side of the 12 portals, on the stone pathway that led to the center of the circle. The only difference that caught her eye was that the tall black obelisk in the center of the structure was glowing with a quiet black light. The light faded momentarily. She approached the stone and placed her horn against the mirrored black surface, but felt nothing. She glanced around, not sure what she hoped to see. She had expected to be transported to the land of The Men, or to at least see visions of the Men as she had with Liba, but it seemed she had just leap through a non-magical gate.</p>

      <p>Aila turned to face the portal she had just come through. The stone pathway led directly to it from here, but there were diverging paths that led to either side of each of the gates.</p>

      <p>She sent out a large pulse of awareness, which informed her that she was in fact in the exact same place, give or take a few paces, as before she had jumped through the gate. What had happened? Were the gates broken? Did she not do it right?</p>

      <p>Curious. She stepped forward to inspect the portal she had come through, but as soon as she looked up she was startled by her reflection. What had been a swirl of indecipherable images and lights on the other side was from this vantage as smooth as a still pond in the morning. In the surface she saw her new incarnation for the first time.</p>

      <p>Aila had of course seen herself in reflective waters, and she had the awareness of her self as seen through her connections and sharing of thoughts with her friends and family of the herd. But this was the first time she had seen herself with her own eyes standing straight and tall. The mirror was true and the reflection perfect. She noticed her wings hanging loosely at her sides. One was nearly touching the ground! She adjusted them by pulling them back and tucking them in, and she admired the form they created. She looked like a swan! Curious, she spread her wings wide, and then directed them forward so that she could see the magnificence of the featherwork inside. She curled them forward and found that she could overlap them in front of herself so that just her eyes and horn were visible. She gave a brief flap and imagined what she would look like in flight, but found she didn&#8217;t have to imagine &#2013; she was already several inches off the ground.</p>

      <p>This mirror was intriguing! She stepped close to the portal. Her horn was glowing hot pink, and tiny tendrils of magic vapor was drifting off her it and her face. Her eyes looked severe in a way she would not have expected, and as she cocked her head a few degrees to the side, the unicorn in the mirror did the opposite. She analyzed her feelings to try to coordinate herself to what she was seeing. She was admittedly a bit nervous and confused &#2013; what had she just done, and why wasn&#8217;t the portal working? She opened her mouth and watched the mirror mimic her. She stuck out her tongue and flipped her ears forward and crossed her eyes, and the mirror copied it all. She looked absurd! Aila laughed, and the unicorn in the portal laughed and she saw that she looked a bit more relaxed.</p>

      <p>Oops &#2013; she noticed there was a bit of lichen on the top edge of her nose. She bent her head downward and lifted her right hoof up so that she could paw it off, but as she did so her horn connected with something hard and inert. The mirror! And then she remembered; Tabor had sealed the portal from the world of men.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;What have I done?&#8221; Had she in fact transported somewhere? Was <em>this</em> the world of Men? Was she trapped here for a hundred years? When had he sealed this gate?</p>

      <p>She stepped around the mirror, and examined the portal from the far side, the side she had initially leapt through. Instead of the swirling mass she had thought to see, there was nothing &#2013; just a thin, nearly invisible frame. The black obelisk was visible in the center of the hill. She walked through the frame and turned around to see the mirror once again. She was at last convinced that she had indeed landed in a different realm.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Hunt</p>

      <p>Aila turned and exited the inner circle via the path near the mirror and circumnavigated the portals. Each of the other eleven gates matched the first; they were all empty frames. She wondered what she was meant to do. Why on earth had Tabor lead her here? Had she in fact ever even seen him, or was that just an illusion brought on by the magic pond water she had drunk? She still felt abuzz with the energy she had consumed there, but she noticed her stomach was grumbling. Unicorns had to eat!</p>

      <p>With nowhere else in mind, she decided to had south towards Naranthal and her home pastures. As she trotted down the path through the giant cypress trees, everything looked the same but something felt remarkably different. She couldn&#8217;t tell what unnerved her, but she was on high alert and keenly aware of her surrounds. She sent out pulses numerous times, but it was indeed the landscape she was familiar with. Something was wrong, she knew; it was almost as if something was missing. Ah, it was the animals. Or, rather, the absence of them that she detected. She couldn&#8217;t sense any other being anywhere nearby.</p>

      <p>She passed through the Cypress, and out through the trails that were cut into the low tangle of brambles and rhododendrons that demarcated the transition from forest to plain. She had only traversed this trail on a couple occasions but she recognized nearly every step. Soon she came to a small shaded thicket rich with ivy and tall weeping willows. There she stopped abruptly. Her keen hearing and smell forewarned her of the arrival of her friends the rabbit and the fox as they ran through the underbrush. So there were animals here after all!</p>

      <p>As they scurried through the brush and onto the trail, Aila called out, &#8220;Hello Bisky, Tiffle! Where are you off to in such a hurry?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Before she had finished her greeting, the rabbit, upon rounding the bend, halted in his tracks for a fraction of a second and darted off into the brambles. Aila saw that a tuft of hair was left dangling from a particularly nasty looking thorn near the ground. In a breath, the fox crashed through the mesh of brambles after the rabbit, and Aila stood open-mouthed. She was awash in the wake of uncomfortable feelings. This was no game they were playing!</p>

      <p>Concerned, Aila circled back around the thickest of the the bushes to a spot that was clear enough for her to sneak through into the network of blackberries and tall gangly shrubs, and she cantered over to where she saw Tiffle, the red fox, at rest. She felt a terrible nausea hit her then, and shook her head from left to right, trying to shake it off.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Tiffle! What are you doing?&#8221; She thought out loud to the fox as she approached.</p>

      <p>The fox turned to her &#2013; something dangled loosely from his mouth &#2013; and immediately sprang away and disappeared into the deep forest before Aila could get close.</p>

      <p>&#8216;What is this? What is happening!&#8217;, she thought. &#8216;Is Tiffle afraid of <em>me</em>? Whatever for?&#8217;</p>

      <p>She walked forward and was stunned to see the rabbits torn body, in pieces on the ground, lifeless.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh Bisky, you poor animal! What has he done to you?&#8221;</p>

      <p>She examined the rabbit with her horn, but parts were missing, and he was beyond restoration. The hungry fox had killed the wild hare.</p>

      <p>Aila felt sick. She impulsively spread her wings and flew several meters into the air, cresting the tree-line, seeking vainly to evade her own thoughts. What was wrong with an animal that could make it do that? She had never seen an intentional felling before! It made no sense to her. She wished she could go back and stop the atrocity before it happened, but there was nothing she could do about it.</p>

      <p>Instead she breathed, and she focused on the sensation of the wind in her wingtips. She instinctively sent out a pulse and turned in the air for Naranthal, her home. She didn&#8217;t know what else to do.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Wagon</p>

      <p>Aila&#8217;s emotional state stabilized rapidly. Flying was still a new activity for her and it consumed much of her attention. She stayed low in the sky, barely above the treetops and focused on trying to remain as steady as possible. She found that the more she focused on her task the less successful she became, but when she concentrated on the direction she was going, her wings and body stabilized. As she progressed, she found that when she focused on her empty belly, or the delicious golden fields of Naranthal, her flying was at its best.</p>

      <p>When the trees dwindled down to a smattering and the grasses of Algaron grew in earnest, she landed for a quick bite. This was not favored pastureland of her herd, as the tall grasses here grew bitter and woody with sharp edges, but she was hungry, and she could of course eat and walk.</p>

      <p>Hours had passed since her encounter with the fox and rabbit, and though it was unlike her to dwell, she kept remembering the look that fox had given her before he disappeared. It was as though he knew what he had done was wrong, but he simultaneously enjoyed it. Maybe she was reading too much into the look in his eyes, but it haunted her. A part of poor Bisky dangling from his mouth&#8230; he had been <em>eating</em> him. Why would he do that? He must have been starving. That would explain the pleasure in his eyes. Aila herself was currently feeding her empty stomach. But there was plenty of food here, so that didn&#8217;t make much sense.</p>

      <p>She stumbled upon a patch of lush green clover and chomped at it voraciously, and she was grateful for the switch from the tall grass which she found barely palatable. Tabor came to mind again, and she reminded herself of her morning. Things were clearly different now, and she <em>had</em> come through the gate. Now she couldn&#8217;t sense the life-forces of the local fauna, and to top it off they ate each other. If this was indeed the world of The Men, she wasn&#8217;t so sure she liked it all that much. Again, she wondered, &#8220;Why did Tabor urge me here? Why did I want to come here? And if this <em>is</em> the realm of The Men, where are they to be found?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The answer to that last question soon presented itself. Aila had moved on from the clover and was considering making a super fast dash for Naranthal when she heard a commotion from far away to the southwest. A squeaky high pitched sound. A clunking sound and an accompanying rattle. The rhythmic footfalls of unicorns! Her ears perked up and she tuned her eyes on the direction of the sound. It was coming nearer.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Men</p>

      <p>It was late morning, and Ian and Cal were weary from loading the wagon. They were cultivating a state of bored resentment over the entire nature of their trip. The young brothers would much rather be anywhere else than en route to Hillsdale with the tailor&#8217;s bolts of fabric and the precious box of leather working tools and supplies.</p>

      <p>Ian was resentful. They&#8217;d lived as peasants in the grove for what seemed like a century. Instead of his wish for something exciting to happen (anything!) coming true, or any of his family even remembering that it was his birthday, he got the grunt work dumped on his shoulders, again. It was bad enough having to field errands for his father, but it was <em>his</em> box of leather tools that had been sold. He&#8217;d spent months crafting those awls and burnishers, and he had started cutting the teardrop shaped pieces for a scaled cuirass he&#8217;d been making for himself. It had taken almost a year of working in the tanner&#8217;s shop in order to afford the leather and now he would have no way to work it. He would make new tools, but the setback was dispiriting. He wished that his older brother, Cal, had never said anything about the tools to their father but knew that in his way he was trying to be helpful. Their youngest sister Anna was sick and needed expensive herbs and liniments.</p>

      <p>Cal was whistling off key, and that bothered Ian not at all for he was deaf. The brothers walked together on one side of the rickety wagon. The floppily rotating wooden wheels squeaked and whined, which also bothered Ian none.</p>

      <p>At least the rain had stopped. It was a lovely morning, and the sun had already risen above the trees and there was still a bit of peach left in the sky to the east. A family of swifts raced in a zig-zag across the tall green grass fields where the shining white unicorn grazed.</p>

      <p>Wait, what! Ian stared for a long moment, not trusting his eyes. He slapped his hand to his brother&#8217;s shoulder and pointed. Cal stared in disbelief for a long moment, not trusting his eyes.</p>

      <p>Cal pulled back on the reins and stopped the wagon. He took a step towards the unicorn but Ian put his hand to his chest and made that face that meant he was serious.</p>

      <p>The unicorn was walking towards them. She had seen them, and now she was walking towards them. And she had wings.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Winged Unicorn</p>

      <p>As they came into view Aila realized they were not unicorns, but horses coming her way. They had a heavy looking cart attached to them with ropes and two slender stick like creatures walked beside. They wore brown flappy material on their bodies, and one was making a peculiar sound with his face. These must be The Men!</p>

      <p>She ambled towards them and then they stopped and became quiet. Were they also afraid of her? She was curious, and proceeded to approach them slowly and quietly. She herself was not afraid. She didn&#8217;t see any long knives or other menacing objects.</p>

      <p>She stopped her approach as she neared, and welcomed them with a gently half-snort, half-neigh.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Hello, friends. Are you The Men?&#8221; She was about two paces away, and she spoke softly. &#8220;Horse friends, tell me, do you consent to this treatment of your own free will? These ropes, do you not find them uncomfortable?&#8221;</p>

      <p>There was no reply. The horses stood motionless and vacant. One Men made a motion to the other, and then slowly stepped towards aila. He held something out at her - it was a small red object. An apple! She liked apples! There weren&#8217;t apple trees anywhere near here that she knew of, and she wondered how this creature had come upon one.</p>

      <p>The Men then did something startling. He threw the apple at the ground by her feet. She impulsively huffed and stepped backwards, but the Men stood motionless. The Men made soft, indecipherable noises that were unnerving. She deduced that the Men were gifting her the apple in a sign of friendship. That was ok, she supposed, though she was unnerved by the strangeness of the entire scene, and the horses strange behavior did not put her at ease.</p>

      <p>She stepped forward and took the apple in her mouth, keeping her eyes on the Men. She crunched down, and a piece fell to the ground while she worked the sweet juices into her mouth. She loved apples! As she bent to retrieve the piece that had escaped, she noticed the Men was coming nearer, his limb extended towards her. He seemed slow and harmless enough. What did he want? She wished he would speak.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What do you want? Why do you not speak?&#8221;</p>

      <p>He came close to her, ignoring her inquiry. At a few feet away she felt a faint sense of adoration. The Men did have a feeling, it was just faint! His outstretched limb then touched the top of her nose. She imagined this must be how the Men greeted each other. Strange, but she supposed that for a species that can&#8217;t talk, unexpected customs must arise.</p>

      <p>Then the Men moved his hand up and down on her nose, and Aila found that peculiar, but she enjoyed the sensation. It was oddly comforting, and she noticed a tickle arose and then was soothed by his touch. She shut her eyes and sent him a bit of her energy as gratitude. Her horn pulsed a gentle pink light, which was all but invisible in the sunlight.</p>

      <p>The other men had slowly approached, and the spell was broken when he threw a rope across Aila&#8217;s neck.</p>

      <p>&#8220;No! What are you doing?&#8221; She cried.</p>

      <p>The other men made an almost identical sound.</p>

      <p>The men pulled down on his rope, and somehow it constricted around her neck in a most uncomfortable and frightening way. So she dispelled it, and the rope vanished. She reared up on her hind legs and the Men with the rope fell backwards to the ground.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You will not capture me, small Men! How dare you try! I am Aila, the Winged Unicorn! I am here by my own will. I am free!&#8221;</p>

      <p>As she spread her wings and took flight she noticed the other Men, the one whom she had let touch her, standing towards her with his forelegs outstretched. Perhaps not all of The Men were the same. No matter. She wanted nothing to do with these two now.</p>

      <p>She rose into the air and made her way towards Naranthal.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Castle</p>

      <p>She rose to a great height with only a few wingstrokes. She was furious! And a little bit scared. She remembered back to the story of Marissella&#8217;s sad fate, and it had begun in much the same way, with The Men trying to capture a unicorn with a rope. Until today she hadn&#8217;t even known what rope was. She had heard of it from stories of the Men, but she had never seen it before, and she surely had never felt it. Around her neck, no less. The gall! Her outrage mounted. Aila liked most things she had encountered, but she didn&#8217;t think she liked rope much.</p>

      <p>Her feelings about Men were more complicated. She certainly did not like the one that had put a rope around her neck. In her mind she saw him falling back to the ground as the rope vanished from his hands, and as she played back the event she felt an urge to put her foot down on his body and stomp him out of existence. What a dreadful thought! What a vicious aspect this realm was bringing out in her. She had never had such thoughts before and she disliked how they made her feel. She blew the tension out through her nose as snort and resolved to think kinder thoughts.</p>

      <p>The Men had given her an apple and rubbed her nose. She had felt that he admired her. He seemed calm and gentle. Perhaps even kind?</p>

      <p>Her anger cooled off as she considered this. It was strange to her that the two Men had behaved so differently. It actually fascinated her. It reminded her of the time she had looked through the portal with Liba, when she had seen so many fractured moments of these creatures; some of the things she saw distressed her, but some of them she almost envied.</p>

      <p>If men varied so much amongst each other, how could she ever know who was safe and who was to be feared? Perhaps the gentle one was just craftier and also had foul motives. Perhaps he wanted to capture her as well. Aila didn&#8217;t believe that, because she trusted the warm feeling that she felt from him. The other Men had no feeling about him at all, and he gave her no such comfort. Perhaps only some men were treacherous. Still, that made them all treacherous. She would apparently have to be more careful if she was to get home in one piece.</p>

      <p>Home! How was she supposed to get home? She had come through a portal to the land of The Men and now she was stuck here! Tabor had sealed the portal, and she had no idea how else to get back to her own realm. She still hadn&#8217;t spoken to Liba or Elsie or any of her friends in the herd and she missed them. She may have made a terrible mistake coming here, where animals kill each other and Men try to capture her. Her thoughts boiled again. &#8216;What a terrible place this is turning out to be. Why why why on earth did Tabor lead me here?&#8217;</p>

      <p>She took a few vigorous wing flaps, and surveyed the ground below. She saw the trail that the Men and the strange horses and wagon had been on, winding south towards &#2013; she could see from her vantage that something peculiar was where the fields of Naranthal should be. She followed the road back with her eyes and saw now that alongside it were several large brown disruptions with rigid sides. She knew that the Men built things out of dead trees &#2013; perhaps these were their dwellings. But there were so many of them!</p>

      <p>She took several more vigorous wing flaps. Soon she was near the hill where her mother&#8217;s favorite Sycamore grew. Aila breathed out a snort of relief to see it standing tall and wide as ever, but there was one odd brown structure situated close by. This was the closest she had been to one, and she saw that it was in fact made of dead trees and mud and straw. It was big enough that three or four unicorns could fit inside at one time, and it had a gate cut into one side. Peculiar indeed!</p>

      <p>She stayed high above the ground, and as she continued south she realized that the brown structures were tiny compared to what occupied the fields she sought. The lush pastures were nowhere to be seen. They were instead covered entirely with stone and tree parts and mud and straw and Men. There were hundreds of them, milling about on paved paths and making such loud noises that Aila could hear them from the clouds. But what intrigued and impressed her most was the enormous stone structure that sat in the middle of the entire conglomeration. It was hundreds of meters wide in both directions, and nearly as tall. There were four great towers on each corner, and long colorful banners atop conical structures on each. It was remarkable, and Aila was amazed.</p>

      <p>She flew closer to the incredible structure, and as she did, something atop the nearest tower attracted her eye. It was a Men, yet it differed from those she had recently encountered. This one was slender and not quite as tall. It wore a white garment that stretched out behind her for many meters. It was narrow atop but billowed out near the ground, and Aila thought it looked like a flower. Also, this one was unfortunate because it was leaking profusely from its mid-section down the edge of the structure.</p>

      <p>Aila&#8217;s curiosity got the best of her, she realized when the Men on the top of the structure looked up at her and made eye contact. She should not have been flying this close! The Men&#8217;s eyes went wide, and their mouth fell open. Aila did not want to appear rude, so she flew in a narrow ring and landed gently on the stone surface several meters from the Men.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Hello, Sienna, what ails you?&#8221; Aila greeted.</p>

      <p>The Men just stared at her, their mouth agape. They seemed terrified.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t fear <em>me</em>, fair one. I am Aila, and I mean you no harm. Perhaps we may be friends!&#8221; Aila tried to use her most soothing voice. She was of course wary of Men after her last encounter, but this one seemed frail and sad and unthreatening. Aila certainly did not want to frighten the poor thing.</p>

      <p>&#8220;&#8230;Friends?&#8221; The men questioned meekly after a perfectly timed dramatic pause. Princesses were good at such things, though Aila did not yet know that&#8217;s what she had stumbled upon.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Friends, sure.&#8221; Aila replied.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You have wings. You can fly?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes, clearly.&#8221; She fluffed her wings out slightly, for effect. Unicorns have their own talents as you well know.</p>

      <p>&#8220;How is that possible? How are <em>you</em> possible? Am I dead? Did I finally do it? Did I jump to my death?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila noticed the young Men&#8217;s eyes were red and wet. They&#8217;d been crying. Their skin was fair and thin and almost transparent in places. They had dark auburn hair that was pulled into a loose knot behind their face. They stood on the edge of the stone ground, near a break in the short wall that was apparently meant to keep the Men from falling off. Globs of ethereal black fluid were slowly draining from the poor thing&#8217;s chest. An aura of intense sadness spread from their body.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I came through the gate. In my realm, this structure stands in the middle of a great plain of golden grass, Naranthal, my home. I do not know how I am possible, but I wished for my wings at my wishing ceremony and I assure you that you are not dead. But dear Sienna, you are leaking, and this we must address.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;What? How do you know me? Who are you?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know you, we just met. I am Aila, the Winged Unicorn. I am from Naranthal, of the Elseland herd. I would take you there today if I could but I myself am trapped here. The portal is sealed. But Sienna, you are leaking and appear to be critically wounded. I can help if you&#8217;ll let me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;How do you know my name? What do you mean I&#8217;m leaking? Do you mean my eyes? I was crying, I can&#8217;t hide that I suppose.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know your name, I just call you what I think you should be called. Not your eyes, your chest.&#8221; Aila stepped forward, and pointer her horn towards the princess.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila increased the magical current to her horn, and in the magical pink light that flared up, the princess could see. She <em>was</em> leaking! The hole she had felt in her chest was real, and dark blackish red fluid had flooded the front of her and drenched her gown and a puddle had even formed at her feet. With each heartbeat a new spurt of the dark goop was expelled. She was mortified, and she gasped a slight shriek of shock.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Help!&#8221; The princess cried, waving her hands about herself.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila put her horn to the princesses chest, and into the gaping hole. A swirl of various colors twisted inside her horn, and after a moment it grew brighter and brighter. The princess shrieked. The unicorn closed her eyes. A final bright flash of light articulated the event. New flesh materialized and sealed the wound. Aila&#8217;s horn was left embedded a few centimeters into the area over the princess&#8217;s heart. She pulled her head back, and when the horn vacated the skin, a slight pink seven pointed star-shaped scar about the size of the princess&#8217;s pinky nail remained.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am sorry, I did not know that Men scar.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Men? I am not a man, Unicorn, I am a princess. A woman.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila cocked her head. Of course! This was must be a female Men. That explained her different appearance. Her delicate features, slightness of body, her long tresses. Perhaps even her strange but beautiful clothing.</p>

      <p>&#8220;My apologies, princess.&#8221; Aila was embarrassed and felt that she had insulted the woman. &#8220;I know little of you Men.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Again, <em>Men</em>? Why do you call me that?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am sorry! What should we call you? In our history we have met The Men, but none of them has spoken to us but the little ones, and they did not tell us much. I did not expect that any of you could talk.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you should call us Humans, or People. I don&#8217;t much care for either name, but that is what people call us. Men are the males of our species, and women the females. When you say men you speak to only half of us. I am a person. When you say &#8216;the little ones&#8217;, do you mean children?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I suppose so; I never actually met any &#8216;people&#8217; before this day.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re even, for I have never met a unicorn.&#8221; Sienna held her hands gently over her breast. She looked down at herself, and then back at Aila, the unicorn standing before her.</p>

      <p>In a quieter but more serious voice she asked, &#8220;Aila, what have you done to me?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The unicorn lowered here head so that her eyes were level with the princess&#8217;s. &#8220;I closed the hole. All of your love and energy was pouring out of you and you were dying. I am sorry about the scar, princess, though it may have been unavoidable. All love scars. Did someone hurt you?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess looked down at her chest again. She felt different. She had been mourning for weeks, and had lost herself to her anguish and unrequited longing. She tried not to think about it, but it was everywhere. She constantly ached for him, and yet she could not see him, nor tell him how she loved him. She had felt drained of meaning, and her every ambition abandoned her. She spent days on end at the tower crenelations considering her fate. Life had no meaning, and she had no will to go on. Her fear of dying that kept her alive, for whenever she put her toes to the edge, a wave of vertigo and fear overrode her decision to end herself.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aden.&#8221; She whispered the name out loud. &#8220;He was to marry me. I love him with all of my heart, but he did not love me. I only believed that he did. He let me think he did. Perhaps I just wished it. He made me feel so alive, Aila. He brought me so much joy. And now I have no one. Even my father has gone away.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna had stopped talking weeks ago, as her sickness consumed her. She had sequestered herself in her tower, and only her quiet maid of honor, Bee, had seen her in these dark days. She brought food and spirits, herbs and flowers. She lit candles, and placed peppermint in various places throughout the princess&#8217;s chambers. She made the bed, and took care of the menial chores for Sienna, but there was little else to do and nothing to say.</p>

      <p>&#8220;He <em>made you</em> feel these things?&#8221; Aila inquired in disbelief. &#8220;Perhaps this is a human thing? Men can <em>make</em> you feel things? Unicorns feel our own feelings. We are aware of other&#8217;s feelings, and those can change what we decide to feel. But none can make us feel a thing. None can make us feel love or joy, or even fear; those feelings come from our own making. Our feelings belong to us, and in fact they are us &#2013; they make us who we are. I don&#8217;t mean to preach, Sienna, but this is the way with us. When we love, we give our energy to another, and they give us theirs. It feels wonderful because their love is a feeling custom made for us. Trading energy feels good! I think you have been giving your love away for a long time without getting any back.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess looked out at the mountains in the distance, and down at the ground for a brief moment, then she looked again at the unicorn before her.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I still don&#8217;t believe that you are real. May I touch you? You are such a beautiful creature.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;You may.&#8221; Aila, alarmed, felt nothing but meekness from Sienna, and she again dismissed her apprehensions.</p>

      <p>She stepped closer to the princess and rose her head slightly. The princess reached up and delicately placed her hand on the unicorn&#8217;s neck. Aila could barely feel the touch, but she felt a tiny gentle loving sensation from the princess. She returned it with a soft pulse of magical energy, which she focused to Sienna&#8217;s heart.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You have much love in you. I believe you are going to be well.&#8221; Aila gently sent her words of affirmation, and Sienna responded.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You know, Aila, I think I will be.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Road</p>

      <p>Aila felt pangs of hunger in her belly, so she turned away from the princess to give herself room for take off. She had not eaten much of that dreadful Algaronian grass! But where should she go, she wondered. She&#8217;d been looking forward to the lush fields of Naranthal, but now she was here and yet the grazelands were not.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Wait, where are you going&#8221; Sienna interjected.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, actually. I need to graze but the fields I expected to be here are covered by human. I guess I will head west, to Farro&#8217;s Den, where we sometimes graze in the summer.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh! I hoped we would have more time together. But don&#8217;t go west! My father has lead our army west to do battle with the Kells.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Battle? What is that? What is an army?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh Aila. You little bird.&#8221;</p>

      <p>At that, Aila huffed. She was no bird! But she sensed that Sienna meant it playfully, so she let it go.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Armies are great numbers of men dressed and trained to do battle, where they fight and kill each other. It&#8217;s rather pointless, I think, but father said that if we don&#8217;t make a stand that the Kells would take our lands and murder and enslave our people, so he had to fight them to protect our kingdom.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila did not fully understand, but she was mortified.</p>

      <p>&#8220;They go to kill each other? This is dreadful. I don&#8217;t understand. Why would these Kells attack your herd?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Aila, but the whole town is scared that when our army returns it will be in defeat, or worse, they they won‘t return at all, and instead the Kells will come. Everyone is worried. I had given up hope for myself so cared little, but now I find myself worried again. Still, for your sake I beseech you, do not go west!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I will not. I fear I do not know this land as I once did.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna perked up a bit. &#8220;Oh! I know it well! Perhaps I can help you, as you helped me! I can show you where many green pastures are. Do you like alfalfa?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I do! What is it?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Ha! You can&#8217;t like it if you don&#8217;t even know what it is! Aila, you&#8217;re silly!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I like most things. Though, I don&#8217;t like rope.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Rope? What&#8217;s so bad about rope?&#8221; The Princess squinched up her face and rose an eyebrow. Aila thought her expression looked peculiarly cute. The princess had charms.</p>

      <p>&#8220;A man tried to capture me with rope. He put it around my neck and pulled until it choked me. Sienna, I will not be captured or confined in that way ever again.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh that&#8217;s dreadful! Aila, hear me. I am the princess of this kingdom; I technically rule all of these lands when my father is away. While you are with me, no harm will befall you from the people here.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;You are the leader?&#8221; Aila cocked her head.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am their princess. My father is the king, and he is the ruler of Rothelyn and many lands stretching east and south. That is why he has gone off to fight this war with the Kells.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I see. I am sorry I must go then. But tell me first what is a Rothelyn?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Why, this kingdom. This,&#8221; she said as she stretched her arms out wide and directed Aila&#8217;s attention to the buildings and people below, &#8220;is Rothe.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh. I would have called it Aerenthal.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna made a face that confused Aila. The princess lowered her forelegs and opened her mouth to speak but said nothing. Aila again felt the absence of her ability to know the woman&#8217;s thoughts, and was suddenly curious.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Why do you falter? Is something wrong with that name?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess looked down at her hands, and her face became somber again.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aden is the prince of Aerenthal, the kingdom to the south. Aila, how do you know these things?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I did not know! I just said what I felt this place should be called.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make any sense!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila felt terrible about the misunderstanding and about having said the name of Aden&#8217;s land. But she did not like the way Sienna was addressing her, and thought it best for her to depart.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I did not mean to upset you. I will leave now.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;No, do not leave. I demand that you tell me why you have come here. You said you only arrived this day and that you did not know our lands. How do you know of Aerenthal? How do you know my name?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna&#8217;s consternation was making Aila anxious. She&#8217;d been pleased that her healing had gone so well, and the princess&#8217;s mood had dramatically improved in a short time. But she was again agitated and this was different. Instead of moribund and morose she was now exasperated and angry. Aila&#8217;s innocence guided her.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Sienna, look at me. Put your hand on my shoulder. <em>I am a unicorn</em>. I do not know you or your ways, and you do not know mine. I know names. I don&#8217;t know how or why, I just know that I do. I named Morsha yesterday at the naming ceremony. I have known the names of Esthle, Pim, Nylse, and Neddle. Many unicorns channel this art, but not all.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila&#8217;s tone was soothing, and at the mention of each name her horn pulsed gently. Sienna put her hand on Aila&#8217;s shoulder and admired the unicorns long, coarse white hair.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Why have you come here, Unicorn? Why have you come to me?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I followed Tabor to the gates. I wished to visit the world of The Men.&#8221; Aila caught herself too late. &#8220;The world of Humans.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna rolled her eyes and raised the corner of one lip a fraction of a degree. She felt a strange electricity from the powerful animal&#8217;s coat. She noted that the unicorn was simultaneously powerfully muscled and delicately formed. She was by no means slender, and yet she appeared so. Her coat was almost metallic, the hairs were so perfectly aligned and thick. She was warm. Not just her exterior - Sienna felt an almost magical depth to the animal, and it was kind and inviting. And then she felt an indescribably sensation &#2013; few humans have ever experienced this, and there is no good way to describe it but it was almost as if her thoughts became tangible and they touched something, or fell into a velvet tapestry.</p>

      <p><em>You can feel me?</em></p>

      <p>Sienna jerked away from the Unicorn. &#8220;What was that!?&#8221; She gasped.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I felt you! That was me! Aila!&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess took several back-steps away. If you were here and paying close attention you might have noticed that her left hand that had touched the unicorn had a faint swirl of pink mist about it. You would most certainly not have noticed that the scar above her heart was faintly glowing in the sunlight as well.</p>

      <p>&quot;Aila. Why have you come here. Why have you come here <em>now</em>??</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know! Maybe I came here to heal you. But Sienna, I must go now to graze. If not east then I will head south.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna put a hand to her lip and looked away.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Wait. Yes. Go south. Follow the road south out of town and when you get to the bridge bear east &#2013; there are fields there that may be suitable for grazing while you wait for me. I&#8217;ll follow and when I arrive I will take you to the alfalfa fields. You mustn&#8217;t go alone for there are many men there. But you will be safe with me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila was relieved at this change in the princess&#8217;s disposition. She was unpredictable in a way that unnerved her, but Aila had to admit to herself that a part of her liked that about her. She was impulsive and petulant but good natured at heart. In a way, Sienna reminded Aila of Liba. Aila snorted at that thought.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Sienna asked, thinking the snort was meant for her.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh nothing much. You reminded me of a friend just now. That sounds perfect. Just one thing, though&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;What is a road?&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Front</p>

      <p>King Reginald was tired. He was cold, and he was covered from head to toe with dried sweat, mud, and blood. Alone in his tent, weary from the days battle, he stood staring down at the makeshift war table, his arms crossed. He had lost two entire battalions today. He was now down to 700 men. 706, if you&#8217;re keeping track of such things. He refused to think the actual words, fearing that if he formed the sentences &#2013; even in his mind &#2013; that they would become truth. But his gut was more daring, and there he felt the inevitable. He had lost this war.</p>

      <p>The king frowned. Today&#8217;s defeat was the latest in a series of desperations, though the battles had begun well enough. Reginald had led his army of three thousand to this spot thirty days ago. One thousand archers, including three hundred longbowmen. Fifteen hundred infantrymen. Two hundred pikes. Three hundred mounted calvary. They had fortified the eastern edge of the sloped valley between the scarps of the sister mountains Gaia and Egris with hurried entrenchments consisting of crude ditches and bulwarks.</p>

      <p>The first of the Kells, a vanguard brigade of a thousand calvary men, had fallen fast. Reginalds longbowmen stood on either side of valley forming a large V, and as the riders entered the vale, they let loose clouds of arrows. His infantry had finished the job, and that first battle was over. He had lost 3 men that day, to the Kells thousand, and he let the men celebrate against his better judgement. Though they had handily defeated this wave of attack, he knew well that the true battle had yet to begin.</p>

      <p>There was nothing the next day, nor the next. He sent scouts. He busied the men with continued ditch digging and bulwark construction. He rode his horse Abi up the side of Egris as far as he could, and surveyed the surrounding lands. It was mountains and trees as far as the eye could see in all directions. It was early spring, and cloudy. This was likely one of his last days. He breathed in the crisp air, and tasted the faint dust of wildflower. Waiting for war is a kingly experience he had grown tired of. Days passed, and his scouts did not return. He sent more.</p>

      <p>His trebuchets had arrived a week later: six twenty foot wood beam structures that could lob giant stone blocks at the enemy with great force. His army was growing restless, but they were confident after their first victory. With his growing fortifications, the king himself let himself hope that it would be enough to stave off the Kell&#8217;s next attack.</p>

      <p>It was not. The next morning brought a sea of infantrymen, perhaps five thousand. Shielded and armored, the longbowmen loosed volleys of arrows but had little effect. His calvary rode out in a strong phalanx and was swallowed whole. When the Kells were within range, his trebuchets fired round after round and devastated large aisles of the invaders, but they were slow to load and Reginald wished he had a hundred of the nefarious machines. It was his pikemen and infantry who saved that day, for they fought with vigor and held the line for wave after wave of the Kell&#8217;s onslaught.</p>

      <p>The invaders retreated that late-afternoon, and this time their victory was not jovial. It was hard to tell if it was a victory at all. They had held the line, but now they knew the terror they faced, and they shared the king&#8217;s apprehension.</p>

      <p>Jivan, his best scout, returned to camp that evening. He helped Reginald arrange the stone figures on the parchment map in his tent. The map was sobering and they said little. After they completed arranging the markers, he dismissed Jivan, and called for his five generals. These were his friends, and he knew each well. They were fathers, and lords of their own lands. They had fought battles together, but never at these odds. When they came to him now, he was not relieved for their company, he was ashamed. He could see no victory before them.</p>

      <p>'My lords. We have fought bravely and with honor. Each of you has proven yourself to me on the battlefield and off. I owe you my allegiance and my gratitude, and know that you have it. As you know, this war is not yet over. It has only begun. My scouts inform me that Korvas Kell has amassed an army ten times the size of ours when we set out from Rothe. I invite now your inspiration. I ask you to study this map, and to see in it arithmetic in our favor.&quot;</p>

      <p>The five men crowded around the map and for many minutes made not a sound. Thedlin abruptly reached for one of the markers, then stopped mid-motion and retracted his arm. Agien put his hands on either side of the table opposite the king and leaned over, staring at the pieces. He looked up at Reginald and they traded a grave expression.</p>

      <p>After the uncomfortable silence had progressed into shock, Wilyn was the first to speak.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What of King Stewart? What of Aerenthal?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;No word.&#8221; The king dismissed the notion. His hopes at improving relations with Aerenthal had withered when Prince Aden had rejected Sienna&#8217;s betrothal. Many kings would have gone to war over the slight, and if not for the Kell&#8217;s advancements he himself may have. He had considered it when Steward had sent a page with the news on scroll. He didn&#8217;t even have the nerve to come face to face. Coward.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not send another bird.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Silence encased the room once again.</p>

      <p>Egner stepped back from the table and turned toward the king. &#8220;There is no arithmetic here my lord. There is only defeat. We must surrender.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Thedlin rebutted. &#8220;Aye, like the Lastlers surrendered! Look at them now, wiped clean from the earth. Or like the Castlans surrendered &#2013; enslaved in their own homes. Or like the coastal tribes, the Inquori and the Maults. Where are they now, Egner? You would have us join them on the plains of Farro?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Agien gave muted voice to his outrage. &#8220;We must not surrender, Egner. The Kells have no mercy. They do not want our tribute, our taxes, our trade. They mean only to bury us.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Thedlin spoke again. &#8220;We have twice rebuked their attacks. Here we have the tactical advantage.&#8221; He contemplated the map and moved the bulk of the Kells armies into the valley they were perched above.</p>

      <p>&#8220;We must hold. Our archers will take one in ten.&#8221; He moved a handful of the black stones off the map to the edge of the table.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Our trebuchets two more.&#8221; Again he scooped away a small portion of the stones.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Suppose we place pikemen here,&#8221; he moved three of the white stones to the bluff on the south side of the valley, &#8220;And here&#8230;&#8221; He moved three more stones to a cluster even farther south, &#8220;&#8230;and if we move all our longbows from the north side to the south,&#8221; he slid the five conical white stones from one side of the valley to the other. &#8220;Then when the Kells fill the Valley, our pikes will take their flank by surprise, and our bows might be able to take quite a few more men than otherwise.&#8221;</p>

      <p>He moved another handful of the black stones off to the edge of the map.</p>

      <p>&#8220;We will still be greatly outnumbered. Your math doesn&#8217;t add up, Thedlin.&#8221; Vots had remained quiet, but this was strategy he was comfortable with.</p>

      <p>&#8220;But. As you point out, this strategy may well disrupt the thrust of their attack. This is good. If we can slow them down further, we may be able to hold the line long enough for our short bows to get under their belly.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Vots now reached over and moved several small white triangular markers out from behind the apex of the V where the fortifications were.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Here. We put most of our bows here. They will have no cover, but they will take a small regiment of swords as their vanguard. Here they can attack the enemy from the rear if they stay hidden long enough to do so. Then we might have a chance to prolong their attack long enough for the trebuchets to extend their doom.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aye, this plan may work.&#8221; Agien spoke after a long pause. &#8220;It may not work. But it may.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The king rose. He stared momentarily at Agien and flashed him a faint inference of resignation.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It may work. There is a chance. That&#8217;s what we have at our disposition. Chance. My lords, pray tonight to whatever god or gods you put faith in for that chance. Tonight I will write to my daughter and send her my blessings. I Hope you will do the same. I will resign my fate, and the fate of Rothelyn, to chance on the morrow. But I will not put my trust in chance. I do trust in your honor. I trust your courage, and your love for this land. I trust that your men will fight for their freedom and their lives, and the lives of their families. I trust in our fellowship. Thedlin, Vots. You have not given me much hope this night. But you have given us a chance.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They retired. The king wrote to his daughter Sienna.</p>

      <p>My love,
      Though these are difficult times, I must place a task of the utmost importance on you now. I am not long for the earth, I fear. Our victory here is ill-assured. You will soon be queen, and I have not prepared you for this position. This tiny stone you may recognize as your mother&#8217;s. Take it to the gates, and to her land. Lo, I was not forthcoming about this but the stories were true. There you may find Rothelyn&#8217;s, and perhaps all of Aerenthal&#8217;s, salvation. You know who to seek.
      Dear Sienna I have erred in so many ways.<br />
      Forgive me.
      Reg</p>

      <p>The next morning the Kells main force advanced. The Rothians executed their battle plans and were successful in deflecting the forces. They held their line.</p>

      <p>They had held their line now for several weeks, but at great cost. Each subsequent battle had been won by desperation and chance. At this rate, the Kells would defeat them through persistence alone. They were down to seven hundred men. Seven hundred and six, if you&#8217;re counting.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Willow</p>

      <p>Sienna rode a fine large gray stallion, which surprised Aila. When she had seen the horse and rider approaching, she retracted several steps into the denser foliage near the forest line, ready to bolt. She was not afraid of these humans but she did not want to engage at the moment, she wanted to graze. Sienna had been right, and this was good pasture. Though plain, the grass was thick and bitter. There were brambles and goat&#8217;s heads but she had avoided them for the most part. It had been a while since she flew from the castle when Sienna arrived, but she was still hungry. She did not realize how ravenous she had become until this opportunity to properly graze.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila! You made it!&#8221; Sienna called as she entered the field and rode towards the unicorn.</p>

      <p>If not for her voice she would not have recognized the princess. Instead of her flowing white gown, she now wore a sleeveless grey material around her top half and tight fitting black garments around her legs. Her long auburn hair was tied behind her face in a pretty pattern, and it reminded Aila of a unicorn or horse&#8217;s tail.</p>

      <p>Aila relaxed as they neared and she recognized the princess&#8217;s voice.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Hello Sienna! And good day to you, fine stallion; how is it that you carry this woman on your back?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The horse said nothing, though, and Aila realized that the princess was holding a rope that was tied around the poor stallion&#8217;s face.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Rope! What are you doing? Why do you treat this animal so?&#8221; Aila was horrified. She may be dangerous after all. This was dreadful!</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Sienna was aghast. &#8220;Oh Aila, I am sorry! I should have told you I&#8217;d be riding. This is my horse, Willow. Oh this must look dreadful to you.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila took several steps back from the woman and lowered her head.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You will not capture me, human.&#8221; She stated matter of factly. Then, louder, &#8220;Stallion, why do you not speak. What ill has befallen you?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila! I don&#8217;t want to capture you!&#8221; Sienna jumped off the horse. &#8220;I have had Willow since I was a child. I love him. And I think he loves me! I use the reins to tell him which way I want to go. It must appear awful to you but he doesn&#8217;t mind. I promise!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna reached up and pat the strong muscular grey neck.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind, do you boy?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221; The stallion huffed.</p>

      <p>Aila&#8217;s ears perked up. &#8220;So you can speak! Why do you speak to her but not me? Stallion, is what she says true? You permit this treatment?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The stallion looked off into the woods blankly, as if he hadn&#8217;t heard the unicorn.</p>

      <p>Sienna replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he understands you, Aila. What do you mean he can speak?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;When he huffed, did you not hear him?&#8221; The unicorn was confused.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I heard him huff, of course.&#8221; The princess was confused.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Well, she replied. I understood, even if you did not.&#8221; Aila was less outraged, and was piecing things together. The horse, Willow, understood the princess but not her. The princess understood her, but not her horse. Aila alone could understand them both.</p>

      <p>&#8220;He did!?&#8221; The princess was excited by this for some reason. &#8220;What on earth did he say?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;He said, I do not mind.&#8221; The unicorn was resigned to this situation even though she was uncomfortable with it.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Ah Willie, I knew you didn&#8217;t mind! So you can understand me, huh! All this time?&#8221; And she put her arms around her steed&#8217;s neck and whispered in his ear &#8220;I love you, good boy.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Willow snorted. As Sienna turned to her, she realized her role as translator in her present company.</p>

      <p>&#8220;He says&#8230; he says he loves you. &#8230;And that his ear itches again.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna scrubbed his ear and scratched all around and behind it and then rubbed his cheek. She looked then again at the unicorn standing nearby, and realized that Aila was staring somewhat uncomfortably.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila, I do not mistreat my animals. I will take off his reins if you prefer. But it does make riding easier.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;What do you mean by saying <em>my animals</em>? Surely you do not believe that you can own an animal?&#8221; Aila was confronting the uncomfortable situation the best way she knew how &#2013; with curiosity.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Ownership is peculiar, I guess. It must seem so to you. Amongst men, Willow is considered to be my own, yes. And there are many other animals in that category. But my father taught me that to own an animal means only that I am responsible for its well-being and care. I have help now, but for most of my childhood I worked in the stables and I alone fed and brushed him. He was a young pup when I first rode him, and I took many falls learning to ride. Aila, we grew up together, Willow and I. I still often visit the stables to feed him and I bring him treats. No of course he is not <em>mine</em>, but he <em>is</em> my horse. Does that make sense to you?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Some, yes. Will you ask him one favor for me?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Will you ask him to introduce you to me?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess made her squinched up face again. &#8220;Uh, ok. Hey, Willow, This is Aila, a unicorn from another land. She asks that you introduce me to her? Can you do that boy?&#8221;</p>

      <p>And the stallion took a pace towards Aila and neighed.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Unicorn. This is Princess Sienna, of Rothe. She is my princess. She is my human.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila was relieved. No equine would mischaracterize someone in introduction. It was weird, but this horse did appear to love his princess. And the princess plainly loved him. Aila did not like the way the horse&#8217;s face was bound, but he truly did not seem to mind. Aila remembered seeing a woman riding a horse when she had first put her head through the portal; that felt like a lifetime ago now! She huffed to herself and decided to let it go.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila, I can tell this makes you uncomfortable. Here.&#8221; Sienna made several quick motions, and in short order she had removed the harness from Willow&#8217;s face. She then unbuckled the great straps that wrapped around the horses belly, and removed the heavy object from the horse&#8217;s back that she had sat upon. She put it all in a pile on the ground, and addressed her again.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Unicorn, you are a fine creature. And I do not know your ways, and you do not know mine. But I insist that you trust me. I mean you no harm, and I mean Willow no harm either. Now, will you follow me to the best field of alfalfa you&#8217;ve ever laid eyes on or not?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I will have to trust you. I have never seen a field of alfalfa before.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They both laughed. Sienna reached into the pile in the grass and pulled out a small rectangular object, which she placed in her jerkin before nimbly jumping up onto the great male horse&#8217;s bare back. The image of this woman astride this horse suddenly made sense. It was the ropes that Aila didn&#8217;t like, but this relationship the two had with each other appeared symbiotic.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</p>

      <p>At that, the grey horse lept forward at an impressive rate, and the princess held on by hugging his great neck. Aila hoped she wasn&#8217;t making a mistake as she loped up beside them.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Fields</p>

      <p>The alfalfa fields were not far. At a gallop they reached them in a short time. This horse Willow was an impressive specimen and he ran gracefully and fast. Aila thought that if he were in a hurry or abnormally excited, Willow might even be able to run super fast.</p>

      <p>There was a short wooden structure surrounding the lush green field which they had to jump over, but it was effortless. The grass was tall and grew in thick long rows that went on forever. It had a pungent, earthy smell that made the unicorn&#8217;s belly growl.</p>

      <p>&#8220;This smells wonderful.&#8221; She said to herself.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Well go on then, try some!&#8221; Sienna beckoned. &#8220;Just don&#8217;t eat too much of it or you might get sick.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila did try it, and she kept trying it for quite some time. When she instinctively sent out a pulse, she felt Sienna and Willow at a distance. She had wandered pretty far without even realizing it! She cantered back over to her companions and saw Sienna had the rectangular object in her lap and was hunched over it. She had small tools she was working with. Aila was curious.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; She asked.</p>

      <p>Sienna jumped up, startled. &#8220;Aila! Oh, this is my book. I like to draw and write silly things in it. I guess it&#8217;s a kind of journal. You know, of my thoughts.&#8221; She was embarrassed but she had been working on a drawing that had turned out lovely, she thought. It was a green field of alfalfa with Aila the winged unicorn in the middle, standing sideways but looking towards the viewer.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Here you can look.&#8221; Sienna held out the book for Aila to see.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me! You made a mirror!&#8221; Aila was impressed. She knew that the humans of the past had spoken to the unicorns by drawing pictures but she understood them to be crude, simplistic representations. This was beautiful. The colors were gentle and graceful, and it was obviously her on the page, down to her glowing-pink horn.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It is wonderful, Sienna.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Thanks, Aila.&#8221; She folded the book up and put it back inside her shirt. &#8220;Are you still hungry? I can take you to some hay next if you like. You probably shouldn&#8217;t eat too much more Alfalfa.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila was still hungry, even thought the sweet earthy alfalfa had gone a long way at restoring her energy. Aila didn&#8217;t know what hay was, but she decided to trust Sienna this time.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes, that sounds nice.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They hopped the fence again, and trotted leisurely down the dirt road heading farther south. Willow was a quiet animal, and the three of them made their way in silence, side by side. The terrain here was familiar to Aila, but the surroundings were different enough to disorient her. The soft, rolling hills comforted her, but the fences and occasional buildings felt strange and wrong. Ahead, a large structure challenged the horizon to the west, and the fact that they were heading towards it gave Aila mild anxiety.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; She turned slightly to look at Sienna beside her, and saw that she was crying. &#8220;Sienna, your face is leaking again.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I know. It&#8217;s ok. I&#8217;m just sad.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I understand. Can I do anything?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s fine. I wan&#8217;t to feel this. I can&#8217;t explain it. It feels good to be out with you and Willow. I just wish things were different.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They slowed to a walk, and Aila asked again, &#8220;What is that ahead? Is that hay?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;The barn? No, but that&#8217;s where they store the hay! Hay is just like dried grass. I think you&#8217;ll like it.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I like most things. Particularly things I can eat.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Plan</p>

      <p>King Reginald unfolded his arms. He&#8217;d been staring at the war table for hours. He was cold and tired, covered in mud, and the fresh slice across his ear and jawbone was stinging. He was losing this war, and though he had in all actuality made his decision an hour ago, he only now gave in to it.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Gerd.&#8221; He muttered the name of the man he knew to be footsteps away outside his tent, and his steward immediately lifted the flap with a gloved hand.</p>

      <p>&#8220;My lord?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Summon Thedlin and Wilyn. Also, Vots. My lord.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Soon the three joined Reginald in the king&#8217;s pavilion. The fire in the center of the room kept it warm, but they were cold to their bones. A week&#8217;s rest by a fire and a full belly of hot stewed meat and mead, now that might&#8217;ve brought their cold hands and faces back to life.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Friends. Please, sit.&#8221; Reginald gestured to the chairs surrounding the war table. The men sat, following the king.</p>

      <p>&#8220;By Farro&#8217;s fate, we have held the vale for many weeks, as you know. We have lost many men here; you know that as well. Unfortunately I did not invite you here this night to relay the obvious, though I do wish that it were so. Nor did I unite us here to again make battle plans &#2013; there will be no battle on the morrow.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The king paused and examined their perplexed faces before continuing.</p>

      <p>&quot;There can be no victory here, with our seven hundred men against the Kell&#8217;s hoard of thousands. I have come to the conclusion, at great debate with myself, that we must return to Rothe. We must garrison the keep, and make preparations for siege.</p>

      <p>This is not ideal, of course. Rothe has not been prepared for siege for dozens of years. Not since Aerenthal&#8217;s treacherous secession has there been battle on Rothelyn land. Great preparations are needed and there is little time. Rothmew Keep was once a stalwart stronghold, and it may well hold against the Kells under proper guidance.</p>

      <p>Still. The town is likely doomed. The curtain wall is small. In peace, the town has grown wide and populous. The townsfolk themselves must make their own preparations. They should ready themselves for their own protection or evacuation. They won&#8217;t have much time. I know not their fate, though, and it ails me.</p>

      <p>Now. Thedlin. We grew up together. I know your mind for logistics, and I know your heart belongs to Rothelyn. I must ask you &#2013; no, I apologize but I must command &#2013; that you carry out these tasks. You must lead our surviving army home to Rothmew. The men are tired, but you must not tarry, for the Kells will be on your heels. Send scouts and have preparations underway, for as soon as you arrive you will witness the Kells as you have not. They will taste victory, and they will thirst for your annihilation. By chance, if your defensive efforts hold, you will steward Rothelyn until Sienna returns and dons the queen&#8217;s crown. I would hope, then, that you will provide her with continued counsel.&quot;</p>

      <p>Thedlin stared intensely at Reginald. The king knew his distaste for politics and leadership. The king knew his aversion to the castle and even the town. And the king knew well that he wanted only to return to his provincial farm in the east. Why was Reginald now placing him in charge of his arms and estates?</p>

      <p>The king stared across the table at his oldest friend. His look was grave. His full form and rugged leather armor was aged and tired. He saw the fear in Thedlin&#8217;s amber eyes turn to resignation and felt the pain he had placed on his friend&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It must be you Thedlin.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Thedlin nodded. &#8220;Aye. I understand.&#8221; Their locked eyes superseded the pretense of position, and Thedlin asked the question that was gnawing on him.</p>

      <p>&#8220;But what of you my lord. Nallo, why do you not lead us home?&#8221;</p>

      <p>King Reginald smiled briefly at the utterance of his old nickname, but then looked askance towards the fire and his grim countenance reverted.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am going to kill Korvas.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The Departure - I</p>

      <p>They made plans into dusk and the early hours of night. Before the moon had risen, the army had packed up and decamped. Thedlin sent squires ahead, and before their departure he sent two birds &#2013; one to Gregor, Rothmew&#8217;s chief steward with a list of instructions, and one to his wife, with a more painful missive.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Dearest Lil,
      I am well, though the battle is lost. We return to Rothmew in defeat, plagued by a sizable force which shadows us. The farm is no longer safe, and I implore you to take the children North to Falkir. My father will take you in; be at home there and send a bird to Rothe when you arrive. I will hold Rothmew, against Farro&#8217;s might if need be. Honor me with your safety.
      Your&#8217;s in all,
      Thedlin</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Thedlin had men dismantle the catapults with axes, avoiding fires that might be seen by enemy scouts. After that task was complete lead the troop towards Rothe at an urgent pace.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Gerdwin, The king&#8217;s attendant, helped don the kings' armor, and readied the king&#8217;s horse, and before he could ready his own, he listened in shock as the king dismissed him.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You have served me well and faithfully, Gerd. Go to your family, and by all means necessary keep them safe. The land north of Kensbrook is yours. This is small recompense for your years of servitude. Thank you, and fare thee well.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The king handed him a small scroll with his seal, which the man held with both hands as his king rode off.</p>

      <p>Reginald met Wilyn and Vots near the makeshift stables, and they walked their horses swiftly into the dark. Twenty swordsmen, two bannermen, and one scribe followed. Reginald had thought carefully as to this company. Wilyn was not much in the way of witw, but he was optimistic, and eager for approval. Though a man of forty plus years, he was boyish in that way. He was a hulking man, and devastating with a mace or mourning star. He had a wife but no children. Vots was an odd choice on the surface, but he was cunning and devious. The king might need input on strategy, and though not much of a fighter, Vots was quick with his sword and fearless in battle. He was without family, as they had suffered poorly when a terrible sickness plagued the lands several years past.</p>

      <p>He had commanded the two generals earlier in the evening to recruit ten men each. No fathers. It was clear that they were heading to their deaths.</p>

      <p>There was a small chance that the king would in fact manage to kill Korvas, though none of them could see a clear path to that outcome. Far more likely was that upon confrontation, they would be immediately all be killed by Korvas Kell&#8217;s guards.</p>

      <p>Riding forward, the twenty six men each felt their doom looming closer with every step. Even the horses felt the dour nature of their task.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Nap</p>

      <p>The barn grew as they neared until it loomed over them, as tall as an oak. Aila remembered that there would be several men near this place, but she didn&#8217;t see any of them. When they came to a turnoff in the road, they proceeded into the thick fields of tall meaty grass, prompting Aila&#8217;s hunger to return. She and willow grazed while the princess cried. Aila wondered how many tears this human had to shed.</p>

      <p>The hay grass was delicious, and reminded her of the golden fields of Naranthal. Instead of full and sweet, this was thin and bitter, but it was rich and earthy and soon Aila was contented. At some point Sienna had dismounted and she sat with her legs tucked under her in the shorter grass by the road. Aila walked over to her side, and finding herself exhausted, lay down beside the princess and stretched out her legs. Detecting a deep sadness from the woman, she nudged her nose gently into her companion&#8217;s thigh and sent her a pulse of soothing energy. Sienna put her hand on Aila&#8217;s neck and gently pet the unicorn. Soon both were asleep.</p>

      <p>Willow grazed, but he did not range far. He was keeping an eye on his friends.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Dream</p>

      <p>Sienna rode on the back of the great white unicorn in their dream. They flew blazingly fast through the evening&#8217;s golden clouds. Sienna&#8217;s gown trailed behind her and fluttered in the wind. The anticipation was palpable. They were late for the ceremony!</p>

      <p>The landed in the courtyard to a great fanfare. Colored banners were hung and flew hight above the castle walls. Doves flew gracefully about. Bards sand joyous tunes, and trumpets marked their arrival. Sienna alighted and kissed Aila&#8217;s head before walking to the red aisle where her father stood. He brushed a strand of her hair back out of her face, then kissed his daughter&#8217;s cheek. Sienna looked up into his gold and blue eyes, and felt a powerful happiness from him. His grey stubble and weathered face augmented his smile. They held hands and began walking down the ails lined with relatives and friends garbed in their best finery.</p>

      <p>Aila watched lovingly as the humans moved to join those at the grand entrance to the keep, where a gate of flowers stood. She was having a particularly important thought about this event when she was awakened by the clopping of hooves nearby.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Scroll</p>

      <p>The afternoon had waned, and Willow approached the sleeping pair. He clopped his hooves until they awoke.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Horses coming&#8221;, he huffed.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Horses?&#8221; Aila asked. She stood and shook the sleep from her face.</p>

      <p>Sienna roused herself and climbed onto Willow. The three of them stopped to listen, and Aila heard it. Two horses running at a full gallop, and heading their way. She turned to face the north and watched as two riders headed towards them. One was shining brightly in the mid day sun, and the other was much smaller and wore simple brown garb similar to what Sienna wore.</p>

      <p>They soon approached, and the small one shouted, &#8220;Princess Sienna! My princess! News from the front!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila tucked her wings tight to her body, ready to take flight at a moment&#8217;s notice. The two men atop the two horses stopped and the man in brown dismounted. He reached into a bag that was attached to the horse somehow and retrieved a cylindrical object that he handed up to Sienna. He then bowed low onto one knee and looked at the ground. Aila was nonplussed, uncertain how to react to his odd behavior, but the princess was unfazed.</p>

      <p>Sienna took the scroll, and addressed the young man before her as she broke the seal and unraveled it. &#8220;You may rise, page. I thank you for your haste.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess stared at the words on the page, and her face became devoid of all emotion. At the same time, Aila felt a surge of emotion from her. She could not identify it as anything other than panic, or worse, dread.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Return to the keep, now.&#8221; Sienna commanded. &#8220;Make haste. Summon Gregor and Schiff to the king&#8217;s chambers. Ensure that they are there by dusk. And please retrieve my saddle and tack from the fields near Swallow&#8217;s bridge.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes Princess Sienna, of course.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh, and Page, Speak not of what you see here.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Your Highness?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Off with you, now. Haste!&#8221;</p>

      <p>The two riders raced back the way they&#8217;d come, leaving a cloud of brown dust that softly settled with the breeze.</p>

      <p>Aila watched Sienna pry a small stone from the paper and tuck it into a hidden pouch on her pants. She then patiently rolled up the scroll and tucked it into her shirt.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila, I am sorry. This is terrible. I must return to the keep.&#8221; The princess made an expression Aila didn&#8217;t understand. Her eyebrows were curved up, and she frowned with her mouth. The feeling of dread sustained.</p>

      <p>It dawned on Aila that unlike unicorns, who think with each other, sharing whichever thoughts they like, humans could not, or did not do this. Instead they made a wide range of expressions with their faces and sent waves of raw emotional energy to communicate. Aila wondered how much subtlety she was missing due to her ignorance of these expressions.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Why? What has happened?&#8221; Aila asked.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my father. He has lost the battle with the Kells and shan&#8217;t return. He is doomed.&#8221; A tear streamed down Sienna&#8217;s face, and she wiped her eyes with her arm.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Doomed? How is that?&#8221; Aila, persisted.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; She exclaimed more forcefully than she intended.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. He didn&#8217;t say, he said only that he was not long for the earth and that the battle was going poorly. My father is a man of absolutes. He would not write the message if he did not think he was in trouble.&#8221;</p>

      <p>While Sienna spoke, Aila caught a brief glimpse of her father, the king, hunched over a dimly lit desk writing the letter. He was cold, and tired, but little else did she sense. Her curiosity about the battle was eclipsed by this vision of a man defending his kingdom, taking the time to write his daughter. Aila liked him.</p>

      <p>&#8220;If you father is in trouble we must go help him, mustn&#8217;t we?&#8221; Aila asked naively.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Help him? How?&#8221; Sienna had not thought of it, and she now wondered why.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know - I don&#8217;t know what trouble he is in. I do know that you love him, and that if we can offer aid then we should.&#8221;</p>

      <p>But Aila, he&#8217;s a hundred miles from here! It would take us days to even get there.&quot;</p>

      <p>Aila cocked her head. She ruffled her feathered wings, and pawed at the ground with her tufted hoof.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how far a hundred miles is, but I imagine that I could get us there expediently. Not you, Willow. I apologize, but you are far too big for me to carry.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Wait, what? You would carry <em>me</em>?&#8221; The princess was stunned. They had spent the day together, and Sienna would never have suspected that Aila would take her flying.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I would, so that you might help your father.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh Aila!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I have two conditions, however. One, no ropes. You will have to tell me with your words which way you would like to travel. And two, you have to promise not to fall off.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Deal! I promise! Willy, let&#8217;s get you back to the stables. From there Aila will take me to try to help the king. You don&#8217;t mind, do you boy? Aila would take you, but she says you&#8217;re too big.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221; Willow looked at Aila, and for the first time she felt one of his thoughts. He <em>did</em> mind.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Stable</p>

      <p>They trotted casually to the stables, which were on the south side of the town and not far. Instead of the main road, Sienna led them through the fields and small farms in order to avoid as many people as possible. She warned Aila that there would be people at the stables but assured her that they were safe and would not try to capture her. Besides, after watching how the page had revered the princess, Aila trusted that no ill would befall her.</p>

      <p>As they got nearer and nearer to the stables, however, Aila&#8217;s self-preservation instincts kicked in. They progressed, and soon there were men in every direction. She trailed Sienna and Willow timorously.</p>

      <p>The stables turned out to be a great conglomeration of fences and buildings of various configurations. From her conversations with Sienna, she understood that the stables were where the horses lived and congregated. She was surprised therefore that she didn&#8217;t see any.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Where are all the horses?&#8221; She asked Sienna as they trotted towards the largest of the buildings in their vicinity. It was a wide building with a mildly sloped roof and a broad entrance. It was much too large. Aila felt diminished by it, as if through its mere existence she became faintly less important. She wondered how it came to be. Did men make this? She couldn&#8217;t believe it possible. She reflected on that, and remembered the enormous grey castle she had first landed on earlier that morning. That structure could fit several of these in its bottom half! This building was made of wood whereas the castle was of stone. She was accustomed to large masses of stone &#2013; that might be the difference. The large wooden building in contrast appeared unnatural.</p>

      <p>&#8220;And where did all this wood come from?&#8221; Aila added.</p>

      <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all inside.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Inside?&#8221; Aila asked. Her apprehension was mounting. Why would the horses be inside?</p>

      <p>&#8220;Of course. Where else would they be?&#8221; Sienna didn&#8217;t realize that Aila had become uncomfortable.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Grazing? Sienna I don&#8217;t like this.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna turned back to face Aila, and saw that the unicorns ears were lying flat. The poor thing was scared.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh, Aila! It&#8217;s ok. I promise. You don&#8217;t have to go in if you don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They had stopped directly outside the stable entrance, and as Sienna spoke to Aila, the marshal, Ander, emerged.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Princess! Welcome home. And look at that, what a fine mare you&#8217;ve returned with.&#8221; He walked as he spoke, and was soon within kicking distance of Aila.</p>

      <p>Sienna addressed him. &#8220;Ander, this is Aila, my new friend. Aila, this is Ander. He is in charge of the care for all the royal horses of Rothe.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Ander spoke freely to his horses but was amused at the matter of fact way the princess spoke to this white horse, but he played along. He removed his hat and bowed deeply towards Aila.</p>

      <p>&#8220;A pleasure to make your acquaintance, fair mare.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;It is nice to meet you, kind sir. You care for the horses here? Why are they inside? Do they not prefer the open air? How can they graze?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Ander had known Sienna her entire life, and he was quick to drop formalities. He turned to the princess..</p>

      <p>&#8220;Where did you pick this one up, Sienna? She&#8217;s lovely. Lovely horse.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Horse!&#8221; Aila was flummoxed. The man had not only ignored her questions, but had called her a horse!</p>

      <p>Sienna caught on immediately. &#8220;Ander, Aila wishes to know why the horses are inside. She posits that they may prefer to remain outside. Will you answer her?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Ander frowned. He didn&#8217;t realize that the game would go this far. The princess wanted him to pretend to talk to this horse, that was clear, but why?</p>

      <p>&#8220;Entertain me, Ander.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes, your highness.&#8221; He turned again to Aila. &#8220;You see, Aila, it&#8217;s like this. We have twelve hundred horses here, all told. Now several hundred are out with the army, and about four hundred are out in rotation at any given time. But that leaves several hundred to keep track of. Letting them run wild isn&#8217;t an option &#2013; they&#8217;d soon wander off and run wild. We keep them inside for the night where we feed them and tend to them. You&#8217;re welcome to come see for yourself. We have plenty of room if you&#8217;d like a stall.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila appreciated the reply but found that she did not like his response. She huffed. &#8220;Let them run wild? Then the horses are prisoners here? Kept inside against their will? What is a stall? Show me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna did not like the tension that was forming, and neither did Aila. Nor did Ander. The day had been long, and now he was forced to explain the working of a stable to a horse.</p>

      <p>Sienna translated but softened the edge of Aila&#8217;s questions. &#8220;She believes the horses to be imprisoned. She wants to see them.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes your highness. Let&#8217;s get Willow home and brushed.&#8221; He waved them in.</p>

      <p>Sienna rode Willow down a long hall with a fence down the middle. Ander followed behind on foot.</p>

      <p>Aila surveyed the dark interior. At every other stride was a new demarcation constructed out of wood panels and fencing. In about half of the cells stood a lone horse. Occasionally one neigh or snort a greeting. Several were seen curled up or lying on their side in the clean straw. There was a stench of urine and manure. The horses were living in their own filth. Each cell had a gate at the far end that appeared to lead outside.</p>

      <p>Aila detected not fear from these horses, but a terrible boredom. It pervaded and oppressed the space. They were resigned to their existence being the extent of their lives. They might not even know what else was possible.</p>

      <p>Aila felt guilty. She was free, and they were not.</p>

      <p>They came to a large empty cell at the end of the block, and Sienna dismounted. Willow made his way into his cell and Sienna followed. She took a brush from the wall and the tall, muscular, grey horse stood motionless while she brushed him free of dust and debris. She whispered sweetnesses to him and pet him with her hands, and Aila knew that she loved him dearly.</p>

      <p>Ander had approached and stood beside her.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What do you say, girl. Think you&#8217;d like to stay here in the stall with Willow? The two of you would make fine foals.&#8221;</p>

      <p>She snorted goodbye to Willow, and let Sienna know that she was leaving before cantering back the way they&#8217;d come. This was not a good place. It might not be a bad place either, but she wanted to leave and not return.</p>

      <p>Sienna rejoined the unicorn outside and discovered that dusk had descended to greet them. It was almost dark, and she had to get to the Castle to make arrangements. There was much to do before she could leave for the mountains. When she saw Aila again she nearly cried. The unicorns head hung low, and her ears lay flat and her eyes were almost shut. She approached and put her hand on her shoulder. She tried to send Aila happy energy, but found she didn&#8217;t have much to offer.</p>

      <p>Aila was grateful for the tenderness, but it didn&#8217;t help. She was terribly sad.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Sienna, they are broken.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s broken?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;The horses. They aren&#8217;t&#8230; horses anymore.&#8221;</p>

      <p>A tear emerged from the unicorns eye, and rolled down and off her cheek into the air. It decided to make its way in a direct path to the dirt below, and when it landed, it exploded in a brief but colorful display. The small cloud of color dissipated, and a tiny pink flower emerged from the dirt.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Ring</p>

      <p>The king sat on the edge of an outpost of broken granite rocks on Egris' slope and surveyed the misty valley below. The past month&#8217;s battles had made a blight of the eastern side, and even from this distance and in the faint morning light the bodies and mud stood out like a dark scab. On the western side he could see faint indications of tents where The Kells were camped. He knew that he could see but a fraction of their massive force, and his spirit was grim.</p>

      <p>Reginald and his small escort had covertly marched through the thin dark forest that lined the southern mountain&#8217;s lower slope. The snow that fell gently through the tall pines and dusted the forest floor had been accompanied by a biting wind. They had concentrated on stealth rather than distance. The goal had been to split off from his primary force without leaving a perceptible trail. After several slow hours, they made a small fireless camp and ate dried rations. They slept cold that night, and briefly.</p>

      <p>The king had sent Jivan out to reconnoiter the movement of the Kell&#8217;s army before curling up in his simple low tent.</p>

      <p>Distracted by the cold, sleep evaded him for a long while. He thought about Sienna, and hoped that she was well enough to obey his command. The last time he had seen her she was depleted in a disheartening way. She had loved Aerenthal&#8217;s Prince Aden mightily for several years. Their betrothal was out of a storybook, the prince and princess in love, to be wed in the spring. Sienna had been delighted and consumed with her preparations. More than that, it was a political victory for the kingdom. Relations had been sour with the Stewarts since the secession of Aerenthal. Reginald saw the wedding as an opportunity for diplomacy.</p>

      <p>He thought about Cyann, Sienna&#8217;s mother, his wife, the former queen, and though he did not permit himself to long for her as a rule, he did now. He&#8217;d not seen her for many years, since she had returned to her home. She had become gravely ill, and she believed that her constitution was not suited to the realm of men. On his left forefinger he wore the last gift she had given him: a long narrow black stone. He&#8217;d had it converted into a ring years ago and had worn it ever since. He rubbed it now with his thumb and sent Cy his love, and his foreboding. She would want to know that this might be the last time she would feel his presence. Almost immediately, the stone warmed and Reg felt her there, returning his love and longing. Sleep had finally come.</p>

      <p>Jivan approached, and his words broke the king&#8217;s bitter stupor.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It is as you expected. The coward Korvas follows at the army&#8217;s heels. I followed the trail eastward several miles where it provides a great vista. The army here&#8221;, he gestured towards the western valley, &#8220;is by my count but two thousand strong.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;How far behind the main force is Korvas?&#8221; The king asked. He was partially relieved by Jivan&#8217;s report.</p>

      <p>&#8220;None my liege. He is stationed at the rear of the men but not apart from it.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Good. That is good.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The king returned to camp and conspired with Wilyn and Vots. They would wait until the majority of the Kells had passed through the eastern saddle and then approach the rearguard in the open vale.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Ambush</p>

      <p>The king sat at the cluttered writing desk in his quarters, with several loosened scrolls before him. He signed his name, Egen Stewart, to the tail of the page before him and held the page over a candle to dry the ink. He rolled it, affixed his seal - a boar&#8217;s head with a sword running through it &#2013; and pushed it to the side.</p>

      <p>There was a gentle rapping on his chamber door.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>

      <p>His son, Aden, entered. He was a tall, handsome young man of nineteen years. He wore decorative studded leather armor and a high collared forest green half cape. His long brown hair and boyish features made him appear younger than he was.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Father, you called.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I did. Come. Sit.&#8221; King Stewart rose from his desk and turned to face the room, but then reached back and plucked the widest of the sealed scrolls from the desk, which he handed to his son. They sat then at the long oak table and a maid poured them wine.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aden, you won&#8217;t like what I am about to tell you. I don&#8217;t like it. But we have little in the way of options &#2013; we are in fact in a gravley tenuous position. I have shielded you from this, but you must now be informed. You know my vision for a united Aerenthal, but not my many ill-fated plots to attain it. This recent debacle with the Rothian princes is a testament. Korvas has destroyed my hope of taking Rothe diplomatically. His ambition is to rule all of Thren, and he has amassed a great army, which he currently moves east. I have skillfully negotiated a peace with Korvas, and I have his signature here that he will allow us to retain sovereign rule over Aerenthal. However, to retain this right, concessions were made. I have pledged our forces to aid in his claim to Rothe.&#8221;</p>

      <p>King Stewart paused to give the boy time to catch up, and to sip from his goblet.</p>

      <p>&#8220;On the morrow you will lead our men north, and you will lay siege on castle Rothmew.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aden stared incredulously at his father. First he had commanded that he cut off communication with Sienna, his love and betrothed. Now he was to lead an attack on her home? This was an appalling notion.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t!&#8221; He burst. He had many thoughts and was surprised that the denial was all he could utter.</p>

      <p>King Stewart narrowed his eyes and calmly rebutted, &#8220;Yes, you will.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aden found his tongue. &#8220;Never! I love her, and you would have me attack her in her own keep! Nonsense. I won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The king pushed on the table as he rose, knocking over his goblet. Wine spread violently across the table and dripped through the planks to the stone floor below.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You will do it, and you will keep your tongue in your mouth. Or you will have it cut from it, and you will wear the necrotic appendage around your neck instead of those silly charms you wear. And what&#8217;s more, when I am done with you, Korvas Kell will do even worse. He was not pleased that you dismissed my orders and prolonged your engagement with her. Nor was I pleased to learn of it from him. If you even think of contacting that troll again, you&#8217;ll be wishing it was your tongue being removed.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aden stared in shock and hatred at his father. His hands trembled, and he felt an urge to urinate. He felt an urge to draw his sword and bury it in the old man&#8217;s chest. But he had seen his father in this state before and knew better than to argue.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes sir. I will do as you say.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;You will. Now then. I have given Riles orders to ready the army, and his instructions are clear. You will be leading the men in naught but appearance; he retains command. Is that clear?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s clear.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Good. And boy. Do not tempt me. If you make one move to advance on that whore I will have her head slowly removed from her frame while you watch, understand? Dismissed.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aden returned to his chambers. He quickly wrote a brief letter of warning to Sienna, and rolled the small parchment tight. Then, thinking on it twice, he placed the letter into the fire and watched it disappear into smoke.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Flight</p>

      <p>Aila sensed Sienna&#8217;s nervousness but again couldn&#8217;t interpret it. They walked away from the stables wordlessly. As they approached a larger road that was paved with small flat stones, Aila noticed that it went through a large wall and that there were many more people in the direction they were heading. In the distance the large grey castle was visible, though the atmosphere between them blurred its edges.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Sienna, I wonder. The castle is a ways off, and there appear to be many people here. Shall we try flying?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess&#8217;s face lit up. &#8220;Oh, yes, let&#8217;s! What a wonderful idea. I had feared that I would have Gregor in a foul mood by the time I arrived, but if we fly we should make it to the castle by sundown.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila nodded and stretched her wings out wide to her sides. The princess approached from behind and hopped onto the unicorn&#8217;s back. Her knees pressed into the large white feathers attached to Aila&#8217;s side, though, and when Aila tried to move her wings she found it untenable.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Sorry, I don&#8217;t think this will work. Try wrapping your legs over the front?&#8221;</p>

      <p>It was tricky, but eventually Sienna repositioned her feet in front of Aila&#8217;s wings. She held on tightly by pressing her knees into Aila&#8217;s powerful neck. She gripped tightly to the base of Aila&#8217;s long white mane and leaned back so that the bulk of her weight was behind the unicorn&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Ok, Aila. I think I&#8217;m ready.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Now or maybe never!&#8221; Aila shouted as she lowered her head a few degrees, raised her wings and flapped down hard to lift off.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Eeeeee!&#8221; The princess cried as she fell back and off the animal.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Ooof!&#8221; She cried as she landed on her back in the dirt.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Senn!&#8221; Aila cried, as she turned around in air several feet off the ground. &#8220;You promised!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect it would be that abrupt! Who taught you how to fly!?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;No one! I am still learning!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Great, now you tell me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They both laughed. Aila landed beside the mildly embarrassed princess and they got back into position. This time, Sienna wrapped her long arms around Aila&#8217;s neck. She wouldn&#8217;t be bucked off twice!</p>

      <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s try again, unicorn! This time, try bringing us up to a gallop first so that the trajectory into the sky is less steep.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Good idea!&#8221; And it worked. Sienna held on with all her might as they gained speed, and when Aila flapped her wings they climbed steadily up into the sky. The unicorns wings and neck undulated rhythmically and Sienna let her leg muscles loosen to ease the friction where the backs of her knees met the wings at Aila&#8217;s shoulders. Eventually she was able to shift her weight further back and relax her legs. In leaning back, she loosened her arms and trusted her balance, and her deathtrap on Aila&#8217;s mane, to keep her perched on the unicorn&#8217;s back.</p>

      <p>It was surprisingly effective. As Sienna relaxed, Aila relaxed. She kept her eyes on the castle, and soon they were at a fair elevation. She focused on flying smoothly and gracefully, and when she felt Sienna&#8217;s fear, she sent calming signals to her. And shortly after that, she felt Sienna sending Aila thoughts of amazement and wonder. She could see the entire town and surrounding lands at once! How amazing the feeling of the wind was! The speed! They were flying!</p>

      <p>The long walk was but a short flight, and they soon landed on the top of the castle where they had first met early that morning. What a day this had been — it was hard to believe how much had happened.</p>

      <p>The princess dismounted and gave Aila a tremendous hug.</p>

      <p>&#8220;That was amazing! I&#8217;ve never experienced anything like it! Thank you, Aila! Thank you!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;My pleasure! It was fun! I like flying with company!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad! We have a long flight planned.&#8221; The princess was exhilarated and exhausted.</p>

      <p>&#8220;For now, I must go inside. I have matters to attend. I must inform Gregor and begin preparing the castle defenses. My cousin Schiff will know what else needs to be done, and I must pack for our journey. Oh, I will have Bee bring you snacks. Do you mind waiting out here?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The smile Aila&#8217;s eyes became oddly complex, and she replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Worst</p>

      <p>By early afternoon, the majority of the Kells army had moved through the valley. They had initially moved in formation to the saddle, where the Rothian&#8217;s defenses had been positioned, and stopped. Several hours passed before the army continued, narrowing and funneling through the narrow passage. Vots reported that the Kells had sent scouts out in several directions but none back to the west.</p>

      <p>As the sun broke through the grey clouds, King Reginald commanded his scribe, Talmund, to detach from the group and stay out of sight so that he might record the history of the day. And he commanded Jivan to stay with Talmund so that he might relay news to Rothmew. He released the remainder of his men from service and urged them to return to their homes and salvage what they could of their futures. None did, however; instead the two dozen men marched with him upon the Kell&#8217;s rear ward. Vots and Wilyn walked beside their king and flew Rothelyn&#8217;s blue banners.</p>

      <p>His plan, foolish though it was, worked, and they soon found themselves face to face with the royal guard.</p>

      <p>Reginald walked ten paces toward the enemy and stood motionless. He drew his sword, planted it in the ground tip first, and yelled, &#8220;I demand audience with Korvas Kell!&#8221;</p>

      <p>There was a slight commotion as the news spread deep into the ranks. Eventually an aisle formed as the Kells made way for their king. They wore black armor and black helmets with red combs. The effect was terrifying.</p>

      <p>Korvas emerged. He was a short man, and thin beneath his own black armor. His was more decorated with leather studs and buckles, and behind him trailed a red and black cape, emblazoned with the raven that was the Kells crest. His black hair glistened in the sun which made his pale white face appear ghostly. Despite his stature, he was an intimidating figure, evidenced in the way his men shrank back from his approach. What unexpectedly unnerved Reginald, however, was his grin. He looked like a starving man with a stolen a turkey leg.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Ah, good king Reginald.&#8221; Korvas spit out the words with dramatic pauses between each syllable and approached the king as he continued. &#8220;You honor me with your presence. How good of you. But I wonder. Why have you come? Do you wish to bend your knee? To pay tribute for the many lives you have taken? Do you wish to beg for mercy? Tell me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I have come to challenge you in combat, Korvas. Hand to hand. Fight me now, or be dishonored before your men.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Korvas looked stunned. He traded glances with the men behind him, first glancing over his shoulder, then over his right.</p>

      <p>&#8220;An interesting proposition, my fellow king.&#8221; He took another step closer. &#8220;But I think I must decline&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <p>Before he had finished breathing out his last syllable, Korvas had drawn a dagger with his left hand and thrust it directly into the front of Reginald&#8217;s throat.</p>

      <p>&#8220;&#8230;because, my lord, it appears that you are already dead.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Korvas extricated his blade with an equally quick motion. King Reginald fell to his knees and clutched his neck with his gauntleted hands. As he fell face first into the mud, Korvas turned and disappeared into the crowd of soldiers.</p>

      <p>Vots and Wilyn dropped their banners and had taken several running strides towards the Kells before arrows found their marks, and they fell. It was Kurn, the youngest Rothian &#2013; and if it were to be measured, the most afraid &#2013; who alone managed to strike a killing blow with his sword before he succumbed to the will of the arrows and the tip of a lance that had found his gut.</p>

      <p>Talmund and Jivan watched in numb silence from a distance as the scene unfolded. They had expected the worst, but they had been unable to imagine it.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Night</p>

      <p>Aila reflected on the day as she waited for the princess. She had been on adventures at home but they had consisted of her and Liba or Elsie walking to the edges of their grassland, or to the gates, or to strange forests where they would make new animal friends. This was different. She made a mental recap of the day, starting with leaping through the gates to this land of humans. She&#8217;d seen a fox eat a rabbit, been attacked by men with rope, met Sienna and Willow, discovered alfalfa and hay, dreamt with the princess, seen the stables, and finally, flown with a woman on her back. A strange day indeed!</p>

      <p>Ah, Liba. She missed her friend. She found that she didn&#8217;t wish she was home, however, she wished that Liba could be here, experiencing this exciting land with her.</p>

      <p>A woman emerged from the large entrance to the keep, and behind her two men followed carrying large items. The woman halted abruptly and gestured to the men when she saw Aila. They placed the objects on the ground and retreated into the keep, shutting the doors behind them.</p>

      <p>Bee slowly approached the unicorn. In a quiet voice that was almost a whisper she said, &#8220;So you are real after all. Well, what a fantastic creature you are. You are beautiful, Aila. Yes, Sienna told me all about you, though I admit to have doubted her. It&#8217;s not everyday that we get unicorns visiting Rothe. Oh, how rude of me. I should introduce myself. I am Bee, Sienna&#8217;s maid. I brought you apples and bread and grains.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila had been cautiously listening to Bee, and she found that the trust she had developed with Sienna carried over to this woman, her companion. She felt a rumble in her belly at the mention of apples.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I like apples!&#8221; She stated.</p>

      <p>Bee&#8217;s face came to life, and she brought her hands to her face. &#8220;You can speak!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes, and so can you! This is my first day amongst humans, and I gather that only some people can understand me or speak to me. Some people even mistake me for a horse, though I am not sure how that is possible.&#8221; Her horn pulsed a nonchalant pink glow.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Nor do I, Aila. Here.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Bee brought over the objects from the doorway, which turned out to be a bag full of apples. She took one from the bag and held it out for Aila, who took it and ate it in several chomps. Bee emptied the bag near Aila&#8217;s feet, and proceeded to drag the other object towards the unicorn. It was a bag full of grain, with a couple loaves of warm bread on top.</p>

      <p>&#8220;This should keep you busy for a while. I will come check on you if Sienna doesn&#8217;t beat me to it. Aila, I am glad you have come. I haven&#8217;t seen her this happy in a long time.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Bee returned inside, and Aila ate the apples and grain and then dozed while standing.</p>

      <p>Sienna came out several hours later, and they spoke briefly. She was needed for many decisions about the castle defenses and would be gathering numerous leaders and nobles for a forum later that night. They would have to leave for the front on the morrow.</p>

      <p>Bee returned shortly thereafter and put a thick blanket over Aila&#8217;s back. She spent the night meandering the rooftop and dozing. She felt lonely and displaced, but her dreams brought her happiness. She discovered a garden down a small flight of stairs on a larger rooftop area with trees and a small grassy area, and she lay there on her side in the grass and slept until morning.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Sword</p>

      <p>&#8220;There you are! Aila, wake up! Wake up! It&#8217;s time.&#8221; Sienna had feared that the unicorn had left in the night, but was relieved to find her in the rose garden.</p>

      <p>Upon awakening, Aila sent out an awareness pulse and felt Sienna (unsurprising), and Bee nearby but out of sight. They returned to the tower rooftop where Aila discovered hay had been brought up, and several red apples in addition. She ate greedily; she was feeling depleted after the night&#8217;s sleep.</p>

      <p>Sienna heaved a pack over her back, and strapped a long slender object to her waist, which piqued Aila&#8217;s curiosity.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Senn?&#8221; She nuzzled towards the princess waist.</p>

      <p>&#8220;My sword.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Sword?&#8221; Aila was concerned.</p>

      <p>Sienna drew the metal object out of its sheath, and presented the shiny long object perpendicularly to her friend.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It is solely for defense. It is sharp, like your horn. But not nearly as beautiful or magical, I&#8217;m afraid. I hope I don&#8217;t need to use it, but I would be a fool to not take it with us.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila remembered Osiler preaching about the men who had attacked Tabor with long sharp knives, and got chills.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I do not like swords.&#8221; Aila said.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Me either, Aila. I don&#8217;t like them either. I don&#8217;t like that my father is in danger and possible dead. I don&#8217;t like that the Kells are attacking us. This whole mess stinks. But I am not going defenseless into a battle.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess sheathed her sword. Aila huffed, but dismissed the issue.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I brought you something. Figs. I think you&#8217;ll like figs.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna held out her hand and Aila resignedly gave the black objects in her hand a sniff. She took one and chewed it.</p>

      <p>She did like figs.</p>


      <p className="section-title"
      >The Bad Place</p>

      <p>They flew east. At first it was exhilarating, as before, but they flew higher and higher, and soon the wind was biting. Sienna carefully rotated her legs up and around Aila&#8217;s flapping wings and put her feet towards the unicorns waist. Lying prone in that manner kept her warmer, and for a brief period while flying through the clouds she relaxed and drifted off to sleep. She dreamt she was flying on the back of a unicorn through the clouds when a patch of sun broke through and revealed a colorful rainbow. She woke with a start, disoriented, and remembered quickly that she was in fact lying on the back of a unicorn, flying through the clouds. There was no rainbow, however, and a feeling of dread returned as she recalled their destination. If her father was in fact in trouble, what could she possible do to help? She had rudimentary skills with a sword at best, and her thin leather armor was hardly good at keeping mosquitoes at bay. She felt Aila send her hopeful energy &#2013; it felt like being filled up with warm water &#2013; and she put the fear aside. It didn&#8217;t matter what she could do, it mattered only that she did what she could.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Did you see the rainbow?&#8221; Aila called. &#8220;It was remarkable!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila, I dreamt that! It was a dream!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh. I thought it was real.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The rest of the flight was uneventful, aside from an awkward exchange with a small flock of geese that insisted on occupying their air space. They flew for a long time before a pair of mountaintops pierced the surface of the clouds, at which point Aila descended. Dropping through the clouds was scary, and Sienna gasped several times before Aila could calm her.</p>

      <p>They emerged near the famed sister mountains, Gaia, to the north and Egris, to the south. Sienna surveyed the road that wound through the lesser mountains and traced the line from the foothills up through the forest to the pass, but she saw nothing of much interest. As they neared the pass, the ground rose to meet their elevation and before long they were no more than a few dozen meters above ground. They tracked the forested path and Sienna watched closely for signs of battle.</p>

      <p>Pffft!</p>

      <p>Something sharp and fast pierced through Aila&#8217;s left wing and glanced across Sienna&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

      <p>Pfffft!</p>

      <p>Pfffft! Pffffft! Pffft!</p>

      <p>Several more flew past.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Arrows! Aila, fly!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna wasn&#8217;t sure how she had missed them, but there were a half-dozen men in black leather armor below them and to their left in the middle of the road. The men had bows and were excitedly taking shots.</p>

      <p>Pffft!</p>

      <p>Pffft!</p>

      <p>Another arrow flew through Aila&#8217;s wing and this one embedded itself into the back of Sienna&#8217;s arm. Another pierced Aila&#8217;s shoulder, and mid-flight, she reared in pain and nearly threw Sienna from her perch. They stabilized, and Sienna reached for the arrow in the unicorn&#8217;s shoulder but as she grabbed it, it dematerialized and was gone. She watched as the bloody hole in her friend&#8217;s hide reconstituted itself and was healed over as though it had never been there.</p>

      <p>Her shoulder throbbed, and Sienna reached back to remove the arrow there, but found nothing but a hole in her leather and an incredible amount of pain.</p>

      <p>Aila stepped into super speed, and headed for the valley between the mountains. They were heading that way anyway, and it looked like good cover. She darted to a narrow section between the slopes of the two mountains at the edge of the valley and landed.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What happened, Sean? Why did they hurt us?&#8221;</p>

      <p>There was no reply, as Sienna had fainted from the pain of the wound. As Aila landed and came to a stop, her friend slipped slowly off her back and fell face down onto the ground.</p>

      <p>Aila paced nervously back and forth beside Sienna before nudging her with her nose. She could feel that Sienna&#8217;s life force was strong, but none of her thoughts or emotions were available. It was strange how accustomed to them Aila had become. She bowed and nudged her horn into the hole in the back of Sienna&#8217;s leather vest, and her horn flashed white.</p>

      <p>Minutes later Sienna roused.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; She stood and dusted herself off.</p>

      <p>&#8220;We landed. Your head went away for a while. I am glad you are back. Sienna. This is a bad place.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Fall</p>

      <p>Remounted, Sienna and Aila walked through the remains of the Rothian defenses. Ditches were cut into the earth and nearly filled with dead men. A man with numerous arrows in his chest was draped backwards over a short fence made of logs, clutching his sword. They crested the low hill which opened out over the valley where they saw that the gore stretched before them deep into the valley. Aila noted that the bodies of men and horse alike were sprawled across the slope. To either side of the broad valley were piles of bodies. The earth was black with mud and blood.</p>

      <p>Aila was stupefied. She was tired from the flight, and healing Sienna&#8217;s shoulder had depleted a strange amount of her energy. The sights spread out before her brought on an inescapable despair.</p>

      <p>Sienna felt numb, though not as drained as the unicorn. She felt Aila&#8217;s shock and confusion and rubbed her friend&#8217;s neck, sending vain assurances.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s fly over, Aila. I must look for my father&#8217;s banners.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I want to leave this place, Sienna. Look, they have fallen so many. And the horses&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I know. We will leave soon. You can go if you must, but I must learn what has become of my father.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t leave you. Not here.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They flew in large low circles over the valley, and Sienna shouted, &#8220;There!&#8221; Her voice was filled with anxiety.</p>

      <p>They landed near where two blue banners lay. One was twisted and had been trod into the mud, but the other lay flat and exposed the white marks of the Rothian sigil: a rearing horse, with angular wings reaching skyward. Aila stashed the curiosity away in her mind for the time being because Sienna was calling.</p>

      <p>She had dismounted and started running in a single motion. She recognized her father&#8217;s blue cape and silver armor from overhead as they descended. She ran to him, and cried for Aila as she reached his body.</p>

      <p>Aila approached tentatively. There were long knives &#2013; swords &#2013; and dead men in great number here.</p>

      <p>Sienna struggled to turn her father over. He was a big man, and his armor made him nearly impossible to lift. Aila helped by dragging her hoof across his body and toward her. He flopped onto his back, his hands were a mess of blood and leather and steel at his throat. Sienna moved his hands away from the wound and blood flowed from his neck in slow steady pulses.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila, he&#8217;s alive!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;He is. Sienna. Move aside. You may not want to watch this.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna backed away but kept her eyes transfixed on her father and friend.</p>

      <p>Aila awkwardly spread her front legs and tucked her chin, then decisively plunged her horn into the dying man&#8217;s throat.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila!&#8221; Sienna gasped. But it was an empty cry heard by no one.</p>

      <p>There was a long pink glow, and then a white flash, and Aila retracted her horn and stood straight. She backed away from the man beneath her, and looked away into the western side of the valley.</p>

      <p>Sienna ran again to her father. The wound at his throat was healed, replaced by a faint pink seven pointed star. His breathing had returned but he did not rise.</p>

      <p>In a dazed reverie, Aila felt the treachery of the black haired man thrusting his knife deep into Sienna&#8217;s father&#8217;s throat. She felt the silver metal enter his trachea with a sting, as though it was her own. She felt the pleasure this wicked man derived from his action. She felt the knife removed, and his blood flowing out into the chilly air. She felt the pulse of his blood tire, and the darkness come to him.</p>

      <p>The unicorn fell to her knees, then side, in defeat. There was too much death here. She watched several crows fly across the grey-white sky before she closed her eyes.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Return</p>

      <p>Jivan watched as a white horse approached the scene of his king&#8217;s death. The rider dismounted, and they milled about the body of the king. The rider was small, and Jivan thought that they should approach.</p>

      <p>Talmund, by his side, watched as a winged unicorn landed, and watched as Princess Sienna dismounted. He saw them approach the king, and watched as a great display of light lit up the midday sky.</p>

      <p>They had stayed in the rocks by the forest, waiting to be sure that the Kells were far gone, and had planned to retrieve the body of their kind and bury their companions.</p>

      <p>Jivan was first to speak, though he was aware that Talmund was staring in the same direction.</p>

      <p>&#8220;We should intercept.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;True. What a beauty.&#8221; Talmund replied. Jivan shot him a quizzical glance before throwing his pack over his back and heading down the steep scree.</p>

      <p>As they came within a dozen meters of the unicorn horse, they watched it tumble over. Jivan watched as the princess hurried over to the horse&#8217;s side and cry upon it, and Talmund gazed in awe as the princess&#8217;s hands glowed pink upon the unicorn&#8217;s white hide.</p>

      <p>Jivan took a step forward to approach but Talmund held him back. This was out of character, Jivan thought, and yeh he stayed.</p>

      <p>For several minutes they stood watching. Talmund felt uncomfortable as they were witness to something not meant to be shared. Jivan grew bored, and glanced around the valley identifying places where men might be waiting.</p>

      <p>Eventually the unicorn rose. She looked tired, and her wings were dangling loose at her sides.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Hello.&#8221; The unicorn had seen them and was addressing them!</p>

      <p>&#8220;Why, uh, hello. How are you?&#8221; Talmund did not know the proper protocol here.</p>

      <p>Jivan turned to him. &#8220;Are you talking to the horse?&#8221;</p>

      <p>At that the princess turned to him and shouted.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Look at her! She is NOT a horse!&#8221; She then recognized Jivan and her fury raged. &#8220;And you, my father&#8217;s best scout. Do you even have eyes?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Jivan knelt. &#8220;My princess, I see but a horse. What should I witness but this?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Talmund then replied. &#8220;Your highness, forgive him. He cannot see for he cannot comprehend or believe. The unicorn is impossible for his sight.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Jivan made a confused face. &#8220;Unicorn?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila walked over to him. She bent her head down to him, and touched her horn gingerly to the man&#8217;s head.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes. Unicorn. Do you see me now?&#8221;</p>

      <p>He did. A shroud life from his eyes and he stared in amazement.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes, I see you now. Forgive me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I do.&#8221; Aila turned from the man.</p>

      <p>The princess addressed the scribe. &#8220;How is it that you are here? Why are you not dead like these others?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The scribe explained, and described the events leading to the murder of their king. He told of the Kell&#8217;s army and its continued advancement on Rothe. He told of Thedlin&#8217;s retreat to the castle, and of their orders to relay these events in the case of disaster.</p>

      <p>They turned the focus to the immediate, and discussed the king&#8217;s current state. They couldn&#8217;t leave him here. Talmund proposed carrying him home to Rothe on a stretched made of branches, but the princess dismissed the idea.</p>

      <p>&#8220;That will take forever, and the castle will be well under siege by then.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;We could take him to Lorne, but it is unclear if they have been taken by the Kell&#8217;s themselves. I have heard contrasting reports.&#8221; Jivan trailed off, dispelled.</p>

      <p>Aila chimed in. &#8220;I will return your father to the castle. Bee can care for him.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna stared at her friend. The unicorn was tired and sad, that was evident. But she felt something else in her companion. Despair at the days events had snaked into her core. Sienna feared that the unicorn was offering this service not because she cared, but because she did not.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila, no, he cannot hold on and would surely fall.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila looked at the king on the ground He was breathing, but barely alive. He had been fighting to protect his people and sacrificed himself. She pawed at the dirt with her hoof, and looked Sienna in the eyes.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Come with us.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aila it will never work.&#8221;</p>

      <p>She paused again and pawed at the ground, digging a short trench in the mud.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Then&#8230; bind him to me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess was appalled. &#8220;No, Aila, I won&#8217;t have it!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Jivan and Talmund convinced her that it was the best option. They laid the king upon the unicorn&#8217;s back and tied him there with straps pilfered from the tack of dead horses.</p>

      <p>Aila hated the leather straps. Each one told her stories about the death of the animals they came from, and about their job constricting and controlling horses. The flight home to the castle was miserable, and though she tried, Aila discovered that she was unable to fly super super fast. She feared her magic was waning here in this terrible place. She wanted to be home.</p>

      <p>How was she to get there? The portals were closed. Instead of finding a way home she had immersed herself in the life of a princess and a kingdom under siege. Why was she even here? She had run away from her life back home in what now felt like a childish tantrum. For a moment she lamented that she had not wished for a stallion and a simple life. Her instincts had led her to this deathly place. Why did she react with such vehemence against Osiler&#8217;s ruling that coming to this land was forbidden? She wondered. She was alone and tired and downtrodden. She did not want to spend one hundred years in this place. That was clear.</p>

      <p>A part of her spirit had fallen asleep, and the exertion of flying super fast did something to wake it. She might not want to be here, but here she was. And all around her people needed her help. Sienna needed her. This king needed her most immediately. Aila wondered why she had been unable to revive him. She had pulled him back from his descent into death&#8217;s empty quarters, but he stayed buried beneath the colorful current of the living. That had never happened before, though she had healed countless animals at home. She wondered if it was because the man was large, but she had restored her friends the bears and moose and even an elephant. The man was nowhere near as big as that kindly beast. But the elephant was simple and this creature was complex. His motivations were many where the animals she had healed in the past were simple and pure. Maybe it took more to revive a creature of mixed intentions.</p>

      <p>No, she concluded. She was just tired. Her magic was waning, and she should conserve it from here on.</p>

      <p>She slowed and continued her flight at a leisurely but fast pace. By late afternoon she had reached the castle. Bee came to her, and two men unstrapped the king and took him inside. Bee brought her treats of figs and bread and a bag of grain. There was more hay on the castle rooftop, and Aila ate. As she was finishing up, Bee cleaned her coat with a thick brush that she&#8217;d brought out, and, while doing so, sang a quiet song about geese that flew away for the winter and retuned in the spring. Aila liked the song, and she liked Bee.</p>

      <p>When she took flight to rejoin the princess she felt almost renewed.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The March</p>

      <p>Aden watched his note to Sienna burn to char in his bedroom fire. He stared in ire until his thoughts of her abated and the flickering flame was all that remained. He stood, grabbed his sword and headed down to the armory where he met Ren, the wizened sword master.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Here to spar, young prince?&#8221; He asked as he finished rubbing oil into a broad red leather sheath.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aye, if you&#8217;ve time. I spoke with father and heard his plans to march on Rothe in the morn. I&#8217;m to lead the army, though Riles is the true commander.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Ren nodded slowly. &#8220;Aye, I&#8217;ve heard. Come.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They went out a set of arched gates to the practice yard, and drew swords. They went about a series of easy maneuvers, and Ren checked the young prince several times. Aden was an adept swordsman. It was his primary activity, and he had learned from the best masters in the land. Unlike his poetry or drawings, his father endorsed his training, and had even conscripted great warriors from other lands to come practice with him. Aden, though young, had developed a strong and agile body and style to his art, and could rightfully be considered a master of much of his craft. But today Ren was having little trouble thwarting his attacks.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You are projecting.&#8221; He called.</p>

      <p>Aden let his sword tip down, and it touched the ground. &#8220;Ren, it isn&#8217;t fair. I still love her.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Ren made a slow but serious top down attack that forced the young prince&#8217;s sword back up to protect his head.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not. That is why we fight.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The clashed together then, and Aden let out a fury of angry attacks that Ren handily defended.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Boy, what is this?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aden ignored him and continued bashing at him with his sword. Raglan grew tired of the onslaught and deftly swept the boy&#8217;s foot from beneath him and kicked the sword from the prince&#8217;s hand; the tip of his own he placed firmly against Aden&#8217;s neck.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You now find yourself defenseless and prone to my will. With a twitch of a muscle your throat would be open. Your anger led you here, Aden. One day, and soon I hope, you will learn to use your emotions to further your intent instead of letting them negate it.&#8221;</p>

      <p>He helped the young man to his feet, and they finished fighting for the day.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You are wise, Ren. However, I believe my true obstacle is understanding my intentions in the first place.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aye, but you&#8217;ll have to discover that on your own, my Prince.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aden returned to his quarters. He had his squire make preparations, and in the morning he departed for Rothe ahead of Aerenthal&#8217;s two thousand man army. Riles and several commanders rode with him, several banner men followed and the main army marched closely behind.</p>

      <p>Aden and Riles shared an animosity for each other that they each understood. They rode in mutual silence. Towards the end of the day&#8217;s ride, Riles informed the prince that they would camp three nights in order to arrive at Rothmew in the morning.</p>

      <p>The prince nodded in assent.</p>

      <p>&#8220;And Prince, you will ride in the rearguard that day.&#8221;</p>

      <p>At this Aden prickled. &#8220;No, that I will not do. I was ordered to lead the men, and I that I will do.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Riles scoffed. &#8220;I command this army, Prince, and you&#8217;ll follow.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aden abruptly rode forward several paces and turned his horse forcing Riles to stop.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You do not command me, Knight. I will ride where it pleases me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>With that, he turned and rode onward.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Trail</p>

      <p>&#8220;Your Highness, ma&#8217;am,We should clear the field. This is not a safe place to linger.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They had stood deliberating for several minutes. Directly after the unicorn had flown off with the king, the Princess had broken down in sobs. She now knelt on the field in the mud and stared out, as though she had not heard Jivan&#8217;s voice.</p>

      <p>They conferred, and Talmund, the young scribe, made an attempt. He circuited around the princess and knelt in front of her, and he spoke softly, &#8220;Princess Sienna&#8230; We must go.&#8221;</p>

      <p>He extended his arm towards her. &#8220;Come, permit me to help you up?&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess persisted, her face revealing no indication that she&#8217;d heard. Moments later, however, she stood and started walking towards the eastern slope of the valley where the majority of the battle had taken place.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am. This way.&#8221; Jivan offered, and the princess changed angles and follow the pair out to the south, towards the slope of Egris. They reached the trees at the edge of the valley and continues south eastwardly as they could.</p>

      <p>Jivan led them, and Talmund was glad for his directional savviness. He, at Jivan&#8217;s suggestion, walked behind the Princess, and several times when she stopped walking, he comforted her and urged her on. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be all right&#8221;, he&#8217;d say. &#8220;Your father is in good keeping now. Let us push on. We&#8217;ll soon be home. All will be well.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They walked until nightfall. They made a fireless camp, and ate dried meat rations. The princess picked several handfuls of greenish-blue berries and brought them to the others. As she was about to eat one Jivan cried out, &#8220;Stop! Don&#8217;t eat those!&#8221;</p>

      <p>She replied, &#8220;What? Why not, they&#8217;re delicious?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Jivan rose to his feet and looked around in the dusk. &#8220;How many did you eat?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Only two or three,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Or seven.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Toss the rest.&#8221; Jivan demanded as he ran off.</p>

      <p>He returned several minutes later with a handful of moss.</p>

      <p>&#8220;This will taste awful but you must eat it. Quickly. Those are tearberries. They will not kill you but they will paralyze you for days, or weeks. Here. Eat.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I thought they were grapes.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna, ate the moss with a copious quantity of water. She felt fine, but was thoroughly embarrassed, and she retired to her camp bed shortly after.</p>

      <p>The forest grew dark, and a choir of crickets sang their opus and then even they retired. The breeze through the tall pines was the only sound for kilometers.</p>

      <p>Jivan and Talmund took turns on watch as the Princess slept in the simple low tent.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem real, does it?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna had risen without Talmund noticing, and she startled him out of his sleepless fog as she sat beside him on a log. They looked out over a sylvan vista of pine tree covered hillsides.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What?&#8221; He asked.</p>

      <p>&#8220;The unicorn. Aila. It feels like a dream, now that she&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;It does. But she is real. I felt her, Sienna. Where did you find her?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Talmund realized too late that he had informally called the Princess by name, but she didn&#8217;t take offense. The quietude of the waking forest and Talmund&#8217;s quiet voice comforted her.</p>

      <p>&#8220;She found me. I think she saved my life. I was on the roof of the keep. I was lost. Talmund, I was about to take my life when she came to me from nowhere. No, I don&#8217;t think she saved me, I know she did. And now she&#8217;s saving my father&#8217;s. And I can barely believe in her. I don&#8217;t know why she came here.&#8221;</p>

      <p>There was a moment of silence. In the distance a crow cawed. The wind sounded like a distant river as it blew through the tall conifers that covered them.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I think she is a part of me. That sounds not right as I say it aloud. But we dream together, and she speaks to me using psychic powers. She always wants to help me feel better. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m telling you this. You must think I&#8217;m daft. I think I just want someone to know - someone else to understand. I love her.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Light snow began to fall. Talmund took his time and considered carefully what to say next.</p>

      <p>&#8220;My mother told me childhood stories about the unicorns. Never winged ones, though. I used to love her stories. She told me about magical gates that led to lands of dragons and faeries and nymphs and demons and monsters and deities. But she spoke most often of the unicorns. She talked about them almost elusively; she always seemed to know more than she said. I always thought she was spinning tales from air. Once, after an elaborate yarn about a pair of black unicorns that fought until they became one &#2013; I remember this well &#2013; I asked her where she learned the stories. And she replied, &#8216;Why Tally, I have visited them.&#8217; And she laughed, never spoke of it again.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The Princess began to shiver. Talmund rose and unfolded a green wool blanked he&#8217;d been sitting on and placed it over her shoulders.</p>

      <p>He continued, &#8220;Incredible as it may be, I wasn&#8217;t all that surprised to see a unicorn yesterday. I never wholeheartedly believed that they truly exist, but now I think I was always meant to see one. I just wish I could tell my mother about this day.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They sat in silence for a long while. The morning light had been dim and colorless but the sun rose now in earnest.</p>

      <p>Jivan rose and joined the pair. Sienna asked, &#8220;How much farther is our journey do you suppose?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Another day east should bring us near Klosser if we make good time. We can likely find an inn and horses there - I doubt the Kells will travel south this far. From there it&#8217;s another two days to Rothe.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They made tea over a small fire, and warmed up before setting off through the woods.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The River</p>

      <p>Aila&#8217;s elevated mood lasted through the first half of her return journey. It was a beautiful sunny day, and she found a spot several tree lengths above the ground where the wind supported her weight and made flying almost effortless. The flight was meditative and her head was clear, though she was eager to find her companions.</p>

      <p>She looked forward to catching up with Sienna and her new friends Jivan and Talmund. Her initial impressions of the two were mixed. Jivan had first struck her as ignorant, but he proved himself adaptable. Aila felt confidence and concern from him, but she understood him to be concerned for the safety of the group out of a perfunctory sense of obligation and diligence rather than out of personalized concern. Similar to her friend the hawk, he was constantly aware of his surroundings and assessing risks. Talmund, on the other hoof, was sensitive and quiet. Aila felt an immediate kinship with the young man. He was concerned with their safety as individuals; he&#8217;d hated the task of strapping the king to her back and had tried his best to comfort her. Aila was learning that concern for the welfare of others was nuanced amongst people; not all humans cared for others. Some, however, were genuinely kind.</p>

      <p>She traveled above the path of the road below to the west. Below, she saw a large body of men walking Eastward. She contemplated them, and remembering what Talmund had said concluded that this must be Thedlin and the Rothian troops heading back to Rothe. They would be home soon, this was good to see! She flew higher to avoid their attention, nonetheless.</p>

      <p>Encouraged to see the army below, and eager to see Sienna, she motioned to go into super fast speed, but found she could not. She flapped her wings super fast, but she did not magically accelerate as she expected. Nervous, she abandoned her super speed efforts and returned to her previous pace. As she progressed, she found herself tiring. Flying was becoming exceedingly difficult. Shortly thereafter she noticed that she was descending without intending it. And soon she had landed, unable to fly.</p>

      <p>She was scared &#2013; a feeling she was growing familiar with these days. What would she do? If she couldn&#8217;t fly, how was she going to get back to Sienna?</p>

      <p>Her wings were sore, and their physicality distracted the unicorn from her flightless plight. She walked off the road to the south and heard the distant white noise of a river. A drink would be nice.</p>

      <p>She made her way down a tricky slope and through a small thicket to the rocky edge of the clear river and drank. The water was cold and revitalizing. The sun beat on her back and the combination of the cool water and hot sun put a natural spell on her. At peace, enjoying the sensations of the natural world, she dozed for a moment.</p>

      <p>She dreamt briefly of her home, where she met Liba. She was furious with her. <em>&#8216;Where are you, Aila? We&#8217;re all worried and searching for you.&#8217;</em> Aila woke before she could explain, and was left standing by the river in the sun.</p>

      <p>She stretched her legs and back before making her way back up the hillside to the road. As she neared the road she froze, for she heard men&#8217;s quiet voices. She soon saw two men in black heading down the path, and a sense of dread came over her. These men matched her memory of those on the field. They must be Kells.</p>

      <p>Her her heart beat faster as she considered options. She decided to reverse her course and head back towards the river. She leapt into action and took several strides before hearing the sound of arrows.</p>

      <p>Pffffft!</p>

      <p>Intense pain coursed through her rear leg. She dispelled the arrow and her leg healed quickly, but it scared her. She flapped her wings and jumped; her wings gave her lift but not flight and she violently made her way down to the river&#8217;s edge.</p>

      <p>Pfft!
      Pfffft!</p>

      <p>The river was wide and the current deep and strong &#2013; it was wider than she could cross safely. She turned to the west and ran.</p>

      <p>Pfft!</p>

      <p>She pounded through the small stones at the edge of the river until brush forced her back up the slope, and found a small trail.</p>

      <p>Pffffft!</p>

      <p>She breezed past a series of pines and shrubs, and leapt over a log and through a dense patch of ivy.</p>

      <p>Pfft!</p>

      <p>The pines gave way to a patch of reeds and grass, and Aila emerged at a full gallop. She found herself face to face with the bulk of the Kellian army. Hundreds of men who had been milling about and resting suddenly became alert. Aila froze.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Get her!&#8221; Men from the forest yelled. &#8220;It can&#8217;t fly!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Dozens of men facing her drew their long knives. One man had a rope nearby and he grabbed it and ran wide to her flank. They rushed into a semi-circular formation around Aila&#8217;s sides and whichever way she turned to flee they had blocked. She heard the men behind her yelling from the forest. She reared on her back legs and flapped her wings, both trying to fly and intimidate the men. But she could do neither thing.</p>

      <p>Standing tall above the men like that, she finally saw how many there were. Not hundreds, but thousands. Those currently challenging her were but a small contingent of the greater force. And she saw that the men were circling her, and growing denser. She had thought she knew fear but now she understood that the root of fear was mortality. In all her life, she had never considered that it might one day end. Here she was now, facing that reality unwillingly.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am Aila! The Winged Unicorn! I am free!&#8221; Aila bellowed. She pawed at the sky, and spread her wings in a final display as she summoned all her strength.</p>

      <p>Aila, glowing pink with trails of magic vapor drifting off her body in every direction, slammed her front feet down into the ground and burst. An intense pink globe of magical energy spread out from her and men flew away in every direction. The explosion was instantaneous and silence followed. And for Aila, darkness; the spell had consumed her last ounce of magic, and she collapsed.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The River</p>

      <p>Jivan retuned up the sloped ravine and found Sienna and Talmund had continued to make good progress.</p>

      <p>&#8220;River ahead. Passable but tricky. I found a spot not far from here we can try. Should be a short trek to Klosser once we cross.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They made their way down through the ferns and moss and ivy and cedar trees that covered the hillside, and they walked along the stony shore of the Whiteheel River for several kilometers. In time they reached a spot where the river turned and widened. There the river became shallow for much of its breadth, though it became deep and the current strong on the far side. Luckily, a great conifer had fallen there, forming a makeshift bridge.</p>

      <p>Jivan crossed first, carrying their packs, and on the far side he latched a span of rope to the trunk of a standing cedar, and he passed the rope over to Talmumd, who wrapped it around his waist and pulled it taut with his weight.</p>

      <p>Sienna, always surefooted, grabbed the rope and pulled herself up onto the fallen tree. She made good progress and held the rope loosely to guide her balance.</p>

      <p>The bark had peeled away from the tree in several places, and where the raw wood was exposed the footing was slippery. Sienna went into a mild meditative state as she watched her boots find safe spots on the log. She began to feel uneasy, though she knew not why &#2013; she was not afraid of this simple crossing, though she was careful. She began to feel panicked, and she again wondered why as she stopped moving altogether. In the distance she heard Jivan urging her onward. The fool thought she was losing her nerve! Finally she became terrified. Arrows flew at her and stung her sides and back. She felt trapped and resigned to a terrible fate. She saw herself surrounded by a mass of encroaching soldiers&#8230; Kells!</p>

      <p>Time stopped. Jivan and Talmund watched the princess nervously, wondering why she froze. Sienna looked out into the distance of another land. She was overcome by an explosion of rage. Her world went dark, and she collapsed into the rushing water below.</p>

      <p>&#8220;The hell!&#8221; Jivan cried as her body tumbled downstream. He ran after her from the river&#8217;s edge.</p>

      <p>Talmund took another tactic. He dropped the rope, ran across the log, and dove in after her.</p>

      <p>As the bend in the river straightened out, the river narrowed and the water became deep and fast. Large boulders peeked out above the surface and the powerful dark water exploded in white clouds around them. As Jivan ran he saw the princess' body change direction abruptly as she crashed into the rocks. He saw that the brave but foolish scribe had dropped the rope and was swimming after her, and was catching up quickly.</p>

      <p>The princess' body collided with another more jagged rock in the river&#8217;s current, and she submerged out of sight. Talmund braced himself with his feet forward and paused at that rock a brief moment before diving under after her.</p>

      <p>As Jivan ran downstream, he saw a long branch on the river&#8217;s shore. He paused and hefted it into the river. The tip caught purchase on the current and tugged rapidly downstream. He pulled it free and hefted it again, this time towards the tip of a rock. The branch tenuously secured itself there across the river&#8217;s surface.</p>

      <p>Talmund emerged, and soon after he had dragged the princess' head above the surface. He swam towards Jivan&#8217;s extended branch, and clutched it with one hand. Jivan pulled the branch out of the river, and soon the princess and the scribe were at the river&#8217;s edge.</p>

      <p>Blood flowed from Sienna&#8217;s forehead and back, and her body was motionless. Talmund and Jivan positioned her so that she was kneeling and leaning forward. Jivan pounded on her back. The princess coughed and expunged a great amount of river water.</p>

      <p>As she came to, Jivan confronted her. &#8220;What happened! Can you walk?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna stared at him with vacant eyes and said, &#8220;Aila is in trouble. She needs us.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Siege</p>

      <p>Thedlin arrived to an abandoned Rothe. In the previous days the majority of townsfolk had either moved inside the keep&#8217;s gates to help defend the castle, or packed wagons and evacuated the town. Most made for forested town of Kensbrook to the north, or the coastal fishing town of Stoln to the east. Some drifted south to the more agrarian towns of Halstead or to relatives on the Dove lake in Yev. And a handful stayed put there in Rothe, determined to defend their homes and lives they had cultivated.</p>

      <p>On foot, the commander made his way to the keep, and the army followed him through the great gates of the curtain wall that surrounded the castle. He issued commands to his captains for the men to divide into patrol and maintenance shifts along the walls, and then went into the great hall through the courtyard.</p>

      <p>Thedlin found Gregor alone in the hall, and had him assemble the lords for a discussion. He inventoried staples, arms and fortifications, and population. He calculated they they had provisions for three months.</p>

      <p>He lauded Gregor&#8217;s stewardship, and Gregor passed his praise on to Sienna, who had commanded the bulk of the preparations. In all, Thedlin was comforted by the preparedness of the defenses.</p>

      <p>He visited the king, who lay dormant in his bedchambers. Thedlin sat on a bench by his side, reporting the banal details of his day preparing the keep for siege. Reginald had slept peacefully since his return, but he now shifted and groaned. Thedlin was watching, concerned and hopeful when the king opened his eyes wide, reached out with both arms, and gasped, &#8220;Aila, no!&#8221;.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Ailano? What is that?&#8221; Thedlin questioned.</p>

      <p>The king&#8217;s arms dropped back down to his sides, and his eyes closed, and he returned to his slumber. Thedlin gripped his arm, and again asked, &#8220;Reg, what is Ailano?&#8221;, but there was no reply.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Riverside</p>

      <p>The sun was full in the sky on the early spring day, but it was cold nonetheless, and the freezing water had chilled the princess' and scribe&#8217;s bodies.</p>

      <p>Jivan went into action. First he pulled the dark green wool blankets from their packs and directed them to undress. They complied, and meanwhile, despite the risk of exposing themselves to Kellian scouts, he built a driftwood fire on the sandy Whiteheel shore. It took a long time to get started, but he managed to find dry enough wood to make a substantial blaze. He was relieved that the fire created a minimal amount of smoke in the daylight. He built a makeshift lean-to from a long branch and draped Sienna and Talmund&#8217;s wet clothing and leather armor and boots and belts across it over the fire.</p>

      <p>Talmund tended to Sienna&#8217;s wounded forehead, but though it bled profusely it was not a substantial cut. He dabbed it with a dry piece of cotton cloth that he cut from his jerkin and tied a long strip around her head to help control the bleeding. The pair huddled by the fire and watched as it slowly cooked their garments. Jivan made a tea with dried mint leaves and they sipped it as their bodies slowly dried and warmed.</p>

      <p>He circled their spot on the riverside and noted a trail that he believed headed to Blinken’s Path, which he knew in turn would pass through Klosser on its way to the High Road. They would have to get moving soon if they wanted to reach the town by nightfall.</p>

      <p>He returned to their spot and saw that the two had huddled up close together for warmth. He checked the garments and turned them, and said, &#8220;Finish your tea while it&#8217;s warm. We have to get back on the trail soon.&#8221;</p>

      <p>He looked at the princess as he spoke, and she stared back at him.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes sir, as you command, sir.&#8221; She parroted in jest, but as she watched his eyes widen she realized he feared that he had overstepped his position.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Your highness, I apologize. I meant only to suggest that we&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna smirked. &#8220;Jivan, please. I was teasing. I am nearly ready.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Jivan was relieved. &#8220;Of course, your highness. I&#8217;ll leave you two to dress.&#8221;</p>

      <p>He strode off, and when out of earshot, Talmund said quietly, &#8220;That was not very nice.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Rebuked, the princess replied, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose it was. He&#8217;s done so much for us, too. I am not used to being spoken to that way.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;What way? Like a person?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Sienna&#8217;s concern for Aila, her throbbing forehead and back, and her general exhaustion from the ordeal put her into a reflective state.</p>

      <p>&#8220;All my life I have been treated differently from everyone. Others have always served me, my every wish catered to, and no one has ever explained why. I&#8217;ve been the Princess my whole life. I used to hate it when I was little. I never had friends, Tal. I was surrounded by servants who wouldn&#8217;t play with me unless I commanded them to. Willow was always my one true companion, besides my father. But he was The King, and thus had little time for me. He tried, I know. But I have always lived alone. I grew to endure the isolation that came with my royalty, and finally expect it.&#8221;</p>

      <p>She gazed at the fire, and watched the flames tickle the bleached branches.</p>

      <p>Sienna scoffed, &#8220;Now with Jivan I find myself mocking the normalcy that I used to long for. Tal, I think that royalty has twisted me. I have been growing into a person I don&#8217;t think I like.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Talmund gazed at her and wondered when he had fallen in love with her. He squinted and raised an eyebrow as he replied, &#8220;Then it&#8217;s a good thing you aren&#8217;t done growing yet. You can always become what you choose to be.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Departure</p>

      <p>The crow landed east of Rothe, at Illyn, the manor of Thedlin and Lilian Grays. Henley, the groundsman was on his way to collect eggs that morning when he saw the black bird on the dovecote roof. He took the bird to a perch and supplied it with fresh seed, and found the message inside the tiny red canister attached at its leg. The canister had weathered open, and the scroll inside appeared damaged. Nevertheless, he rushed to Lady Lilian and presented her with the message.</p>

      <p>Lilian, or Lilly, or Lil, as she was known to her friends and family, took the canister to the study and closed the doors. She opened the drapes at the desk for light, and sat at the tall wood and green leather chair. With delicate tweezers she pried back the tiny lid of the red leather container and pulled out the small paper scroll.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Damn!&#8221;</p>

      <p>The paper was wet and she swore quietly when it tore as she pulled. The canister was ripped down one side, and Lil tried another angle. She further ripped open the canister, hoping to leave the contents undisturbed. She managed to remove the canister, but unfortunately the scroll inside was damaged almost beyond recognition. She laboriously unrolled the wet paper, and when the task was complete, more than three quarters of the message was missing or illegible.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Dea  il,

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Lil sat and pondered the cryptic message. <em>I am what? The Battle is lost? Return to Rothmew?</em> She wasn&#8217;t sure. And then so much missing text. <em>Rothe, you arrive&#8230; Thedlin&#8230;</em></p>

      <p>She guessed that Thedlin was asking her to return to Rothmew, though why he would do that, she didn&#8217;t know. If Thedlin had lost the battle, it made sense that the army would retreat to Rothe and garrison the keep. But why would he want <em>her</em> to go there? She rarely visited the castle, and Thedlin knew how she hated it there. Surely she would be better off heading north to Falkir.</p>

      <p>She conferred with her steward, Sare, and her chamberlain Rena. After a subdued debate, it was decided that she would take her son, Jaylin, to Rothmew alone, and that Sare and Rena would accompany Henley and the rest of the Illyn groundsmen north to Falkir.</p>

      <p>They departed in the morning. Jaylin was 9, and he was reluctant to leave his comfortable home. He protested and pleaded to stay, or to go to Falkir with the others, but Lilly gave no space for objection. He withdrew and resentfully helped ready the horses.</p>

      <p>The rain started falling as their two black horses trotted out of Illyn&#8217;s long birch-lined drive. The sky was bright but grey, and the rain was cold. Lil and Jay were soon soaked, and they rode towards the castle sullenly, without words.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Marshal</p>

      <p>Aden&#8217;s confrontation with Riles had set the tone for the remainder of their march to Rothe. Both suspected that the encounter would not be the last of it, and both were correct in their thinking. They avoided each other as much as possible, each keeping the company of their own circle of men. But the evening before reaching Rothe would bring their conflict to a head.</p>

      <p>Riles Northbrook, officially The Earl Marshal of Aerenthal, was the Chief Commander of the royal army. He was surrounded by his commanders and lesser marshals, who respected and feared his rule. Riles had earned their respect over years of his command, and they knew him to be strategic, uncompromising, and ruthless. His closest companion, Keilan, the Head Constable of the Aerenthian calvary, enjoyed his company but had a deep rooted and covert hatred for him. Long ago, Keilan had expected to be promoted to Earl, but Riles had twisted the truth in his report to the king and claimed credit for a minor victory that he, Keilan, had earned. Riles was affable, and considered Keilan his confidant, and so the years had passed. They rode and supped with Nat, who was in charge of the conscripted men-at-arms, and Riles enjoyed his company though thought little of Nat&#8217;s abilities on the field. He was obedient though, and Riles trusted him to execute his orders which was more than he could say for many of his other commanders.</p>

      <p>Aden, for his part, stayed with his cadre of his royal guard, which was Commanded by Jamlyn Grath. Grath was near twice Aden&#8217;s age and he was a quiet and stern man. He was singleminded about his charge and would die for the prince if need be. But he did not fraternize. Lewlyn on the other hand was Captain, the second in command, and he and Aden were close friends. They often hunted together, and being but four years his senior, Lewlyn felt like an older brother to Aden. They had known each other for much of their lives. Lew was Aden&#8217;s primary sparring partner as he was the only swordsman in Aerenthal who could offer a challenge to the prince.</p>

      <p>Aden and his guard rode at the front, with Riles and the commanders about fifty paces behind, and the army stretched out for miles.</p>

      <p>They set a fast pace and stopped infrequently for basics and to rest their horses. At this pace, they were set to camp outside Rothe and would reach the town by mid-morning.</p>

      <p>Aden commanded a rest, and as he circled his horse around he noticed that Riles and the commanders had held up and were barely in sight. He swore and beckoned his men to follow as he rode back to see what was happening.</p>

      <p>They met the commanders near a small unremarkable peasant&#8217;s house they had recently passed. Riles and his men were lined up on their horses at the edge of the road facing the the hovel. There was a loud clunking noise and muffled screaming from inside, and Nat emerged from the doorway with his sword drawn, dragging a woman by the wrist.</p>

      <p>Aden drew up and dismounted, and Grath and Lewlyn did the same. Lewlyn stepped forward but the young prince grabbed his shoulder and held him back.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What in Farro&#8217;s name are you doing?&#8221; Prince Aden yelled to Nat.</p>

      <p>Riles held up a hand to his men and dismounted. &#8220;We are taking Rothe, prince. Have you forgotten your father&#8217;s command? Ride on ahead, if you like, my boy. I think we can handle this duty.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aden was incensed. &#8220;Boy? You call me boy? Nat! Release that woman this instant.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Riles interjected. &#8220;Do no such thing, Nat. Bring her out here. Now.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Nat froze. He knew better than to disobey Riles &#2013; he had been conditioned for years to obey the man or face dire consequences. But to overrule a direct order from the prince was unheard of. Contradicted, he pleaded, &#8220;Sir, the prince&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Fuck the prince!&#8221; Riles was infuriated at Nat&#8217;s hesitation. He hated that there was even a question of his loyalty here.</p>

      <p>A large figure emerged from inside the house and before anyone could respond, the tip of a short sword emerged from Nat&#8217;s sternum. He fell to his knees and clutched at the blade before falling face down in the dirt. The woman shrieked and ran to the side of the house. But as the large man pulled his sword out of Nat&#8217;s body and ran towards Riles and the horses, several arrows found his body, and he fell.</p>

      <p>Immediately Riles barked, &#8220;Get that woman!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Several of Nat&#8217;s men on foot rushed out past the house and caught the woman in the yard. She screamed, and one man covered her mouth with his hand. She bit it, and he punched her, and they dragged her kicking and screaming to the Earl.</p>

      <p>I won&#8217;t describe in detail her fate. It is sufficient to say that she had an unenjoyable time before she met her end.</p>

      <p>Aden rode away, sulking, furious and emasculated. His royal guard followed close behind.</p>

      <p>Lewlyn rode up to his side, and lashed out, &#8220;Well done, my Prince. Your barbarian horde is barbarizing quite impressively this fine day.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The barb struck Aden hard, and he fell back on his rank.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Your tongue, Captain. Or is it page now? I do not recall.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Lewlyn laughed heartily. &#8220;There it is. Another victory! Your strong fist of rule emerges! After the battle, and directed at your friend, but a victory nevertheless.&#8221;</p>

      <p>He put his hand to his forehead and looked around the area. &#8220;I should say your <em>only</em> friend.&#8221;</p>

      <p>His smile was a salve and broke Aden&#8217;s mood. &#8220;Lew, shut up. Now is not the time.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Lewlyn faced forward as the two men rode ahead of the army. &#8220;Now is precisely the time, Aden. You need to hear this. You let him override you like a dog. In front of his men. Your weakness weakens me. I will not be pleased to serve an ineffectual king. Your actions today threaten my future. And right now those men are destroying an innocent life. That&#8230;&#8221; — he pointed south towards the now burning hamlet &#2013; &#8220;Is your doing, my liege.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&quot;Damn you Lew! What would you have me do? I tried to stop it! He is the Earl and his men do not obey me.</p>

      <p>Lewlyn yelled in retort. &#8220;You are the Prince! Damn yourself Aden! You are the second most powerful man in the land and you cower like a child. Rule, dammit. Rule!&#8221;</p>

      <p>The prince was defeated. His heart sunk even lower.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how, Lew.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Lewlyn turned to the prince. He quickly drew his sword from his side and swung it viscously at the prince&#8217;s head. But Aden had already drew his own and deflected the captain&#8217;s strike. He followed up his defensive move with a strike of his own, and his sword turned in the air and struck Lew&#8217;s blade with a directed force such that it flung out of his hands and into the ground below.</p>

      <p>Lew leaned in and stared at the prince, and replied.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Horse shit.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Tale</p>

      <p>You must be wondering what happened to Aila. This is a story about unicorns, after all, and I&#8217;ve been telling you all about these <em>humans</em>.</p>

      <p>I will tell you what happens next. But for myself I must preface this part of the tale by saying it is my least favorite.</p>

      <p>After the Kells surrounded her, and after she repelled them with a great magical force, and after she collapsed &#2013; her energies depleted, and after the many men who had been blown back from her force had woken up and begun to get their wits about them, the men captured her. They tied her, and they did many not nice things to her that I would prefer to not tell you about. Alas, these things happened, and perhaps we should be grateful, since they must have helped Aila become the great unicorn she is today.</p>

      <p>Among the Kells there were few that saw Aila as the glorious winged unicorn that she is. Instead they saw nought but a white horse. But there were those among the horde who did see her. These men were attuned to the present and had a relationship with the world that was open to the marvelous. Korvas Kell was among those few, and when he saw Aila and the devastation she had caused, he was spell-struck. Though she lay motionless and barely breathing, he coveted the fantastic beast, and he claimed her as his own, to serve as his steed.</p>

      <p>Though we unicorns are not yet adjusted to the nature of it, bad things do happen. And so they did.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Game</p>

      <p>Much later, Aila slowly opened her eyes. The brightness of the outside world slowly came into focus, and a chorus of sounds took shape. Her body ached intensely. Her head throbbed. Her back swirled in pain. Her tongue didn&#8217;t feel right in her mouth, which she tried to open but discovered she could not. She was on her side. Her cheek was pressed into a mud covered rock uncomfortably.</p>

      <p>Discomfort. She took it all in consecutively over the course of her gradual awakening. She tried instinctively to send out a pulse but found she did not have the energy even for that. Where was she?</p>

      <p>Her right wing was twisted and uncomfortable. She attempted to shift her body to take the weight off her wing, but she could not. Ropes. She was bound! She panicked and writhed, twisting her body and she flopped like a fish on the muddy ground. Leather straps wrapped her wings to her body, and her convulsions had only converted the discomfort into pain. She landed on the shoulder of her wing and bruised it. Her panic turned to anger, and she roared. Straps of leather kept her mouth clamped shut, and her roar turned guttural and remained trapped in her throat and head. She tried to get up, but her legs were tied together; she could not do that either. The leather straps oppressed her, and their embedded memories of death and abuse invaded her spirit. Furious, she twisted and fought in every direction, trying to get free. And then she discovered the whip.</p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p>She heard the sharp clapping sound, and her exposed haunch screamed out in stinging pain. Immediately afterwards, it happened again, lower down on her leg. The successive stings petrified her. She stretched her hind legs out as far as she could and braced for a third blow, but it didn&#8217;t come.</p>

      <p>After the moment passed, she lifted her head and twisted her neck to see what was attacking her, and she heard the cracking whip and felt a new sting. She held motionless, and was relieved as the pain abated. She believed that she had figured out the mechanics of this awful game. If she moved, she would get stung. She decided to test the premise. She pulled her hobbled back legs up to her body and then kicked them back towards the source of the stinging. They met nothing but air, but three sharp painful lashes across her flank confirmed her suspicion. Moving would cause her pain. She was at the mercy of the enemy.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Saddle</p>

      <p>Krenn, the Kellian stable master and Marshall had been put in charge of taming the unicorn. Korvas had demanded that she be trained, and Krenn had but the day to break her. He could tell already that she was a sensitive one, and averse to pain. He thought he would have the job finished by sup.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Kip, Bilkin,&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;She&#8217;s awake. Help me get her up.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Krenn walked around to the head of the animal. Her eyes were wide and her ears back, and he could tell that she had learned quickly to fear him. That was good for now. He looked deep into her eye and greeted her.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Hello Horse. I am Krenn. I am going to teach you to behave.&#8221;</p>

      <p>To his surprise, the beast replied.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am not a horse.&#8221; The straps around her face were loose enough that she could speak as long as she didn&#8217;t try to open her mouth wide. This small amount of freedom irritated her, though, and she wished she had not said anything at all.</p>

      <p>Krenn guffawed. &#8220;Kip! Get over here! She can talk!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Kip, the elder brother and second stableman circled around, and gave Krenn a quizzical look. &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;She talks! Horse, say something.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila had nothing to say. She said nothing.</p>

      <p>Krenn&#8217;s temper broke, and he yelled, &#8220;Speak, Horse!&#8221; And he jerked his arm. A long stripe of pain flared from Aila&#8217;s thigh. The whip had landed across the prior marks, and the effect multiplied; this lash felt like several.</p>

      <p>Aila&#8217;s temper broke, and she sneered back, &#8220;I am <em>not</em> a horse.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Krenn and Kip erupted in laughter. Krenn&#8217;s laugh grated on Aila&#8217;s ears. Where Kip sounded amazed and genuinely amused, Krenn sounded derisive and mean. She felt embarrassed and ashamed, and she decided that she did not like this man.</p>

      <p>After a moment the laughter stopped, and Krenn leaned in to her and replied. &#8220;You&#8217;re a horse. You just don&#8217;t know it yet.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Kip had never seen a talking horse before. &#8220;Make her say my name!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Krenn was amused, and conceded. &quot;Horse, say his name. Say, &#8216;Hello, Kip&#8217;.</p>

      <p>Aila hated this. These poor humans were delighting in her misery. She would not entertain them.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I am not a horse.&#8221;</p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p>The whip lashed down in the same spot as before. The pain was intense but Aila was beginning to harden to it.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Say his name.&#8221;</p>

      <p>She clamped her jaw and braced herself.</p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p>&#8220;Say his name.&#8221;</p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p>&#8220;Say his name.&#8221;</p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p>&#8220;Say his name.&#8221;</p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p><em>Kpshhh!</em></p>

      <p>Her pain intensified as each lash fell in the same spot and the skin on her flank parted to the air. Bloody lash marks marred her white hide. When the last of the lashes came and went, a brief respite gave her time to think. The suffering was too much, and her disobedience was not worth enduring more lashes.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Speak his name, horse!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila decided to say anything they wanted.</p>

      <p>But she replied, &#8220;<em>I am not a horse.</em>&#8221;</p>

      <p>Krenn gave her one last furious lash, then turned back towards his companions. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get her up. She doesn&#8217;t want to play today. And time&#8217;s wasting.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Kip circled back around to her back and the other man, Bilkin, handed him one of the two poles he had at his side. Krenn stood over Aila&#8217;s head and waved his hand at the men.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Get up, Horse.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The men behind her shoved their poles under her back, and Krenn tugged up on a rope attached to Aila&#8217;s face. The poles bit into her flesh and startled her out of her trance. She tried to escape their force on her spine by getting to her feet. She realized she was doing what the man wanted despite her own wishes, but she saw no way around it. She did not want to feel the lash of the whip again. So she stood.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Good Horse. Now we are going to teach you to walk.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Krenn rolled up his whip and attached it to his side. From his other side he drew a long stick with a folded strip of leather on one end, which he used to strike her hindquarters.</p>

      <p>&#8220;When you feel that, it means walk. If you obey the strikes will be gentle.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Her hobbled feet didn&#8217;t allow her much range of motion, but she took several short steps. Krenn pulled on the rope attached to her head, which forced her to turn as she walked. He hit her again when she stopped, so she walked forward as he led her.</p>

      <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good, Horse. You learn fast.&#8221;</p>

      <p>He led her to a thick pole that had been planted in the ground, to which he affixed the lead. She pulled on it but had little latitude. He then threw a thick rope over her back and tied one end of it to her left front ankle. He pulled on it in a fashion that caused her to have to lift her tied hoof up close to her body. It was a precarious position she did not like at all. She squirmed and tried to pull her leg free, but that caused her to lose her balance and she bent her other front leg in order to fall forward rather than to her side. Balanced in this awkward position with her chest on the ground and her rear up, Krenn cinched harder on the rope tied around her front leg.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Kip, Bill, untie her feet.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The stable hands ran to comply, and soon had released Aila&#8217;s hobbles. Krenn released the pressure on her leg, and as soon as she could, Aila stood and then reared up on her hind legs.</p>

      <p>Krenn moved aside and let her express herself. When she tired, he lashed her with his crop, and she walked.</p>

      <p>He had her circle the pole in both directions, and taught her commands for turning, and stopping, and going. Stepping sideways to the left and right was time consuming, but Aila complied as much as she could.</p>

      <p>The three men touched her body with their hands, and this was particularly insufferable. She felt their evil sickness at every touch, and although she knew they were ignorant of their tainted nature and she pitied them, she felt intruded upon and marred by the contact.</p>

      <p>That afternoon, as Bilkin was clumsily rubbing her flank, she stepped forward and impulsively kicked him. She would have stopped herself if she had thought about it, but it was instinctive. She felt her hoof connect with his chest, and she felt his ribs break and puncture his insides, and she felt his pain on top of her own in that moment. Bilkin dropped to the ground and wheezed. After Krenn had finished lashing her, they dragged him away.</p>

      <p>Alone for the first time in hours, Aila&#8217;s despondent thoughts overwhelmed her. She wished Eranor would ride up and free her from this awful place. She wished she was home, in the lush fields of Naranthal, tending to her forest friends without a greater care. In her mind, the colors of that place that felt foreign to her now were brighter and deeper, and the ground seemed higher, the air sweeter. She took a moment to take in her surroundings. They were in a field of low grass, near the forest. She saw many tents, and men milling about, all garbed in black. Numerous carts and wagons and horses were clustered behind her. Boredom and anticipation tainted the environment. She wished she was anywhere else. She had come to an awful place, and now she was tied and tortured by the worst of The Men. This must be why Osiler had forbidden her from coming here. The stories of The Men must be true. This is a dreadful place.</p>

      <p>She almost wished that she had never met Sienna and had never agreed to transport the infirm king, but concern stopped her. Sienna, what had come of her? &#8216;She must be worried about my absence. I should have returned to the battlefield long ago. What if she is in trouble, too?&#8217; Aila&#8217;s concern for herself diminished, and her pain receded. These men that had her hostage were invaders &#2013; they were intent on destroying Sienna&#8217;s entire world.</p>

      <p>Aila felt tears well up in her eyes. She cried with her head drooped downwards, and she watched as her tears dripped to the ground. Two small oval pools of water formed in the dirt and reflected the light from the sky. Dark circles formed in the center of each, and along the edges eyelashes grew and then blinked. An uncomfortable sensation of hope filled Aila&#8217;s spirit as she recognized Tabor&#8217;s yellow eyes a moment before the dirt absorbed the water and they dissolved.</p>

      <p>Hope is not a feeling unicorns are accustomed to. There are different tiers of hope that range from the simple to the complex, from the likely to the impossible. Most unicorns never feel any of these things. Our pastures are rich and lovely, and our lives are the same. We have what we need, and our world is simple. What is there to hope for? The weather is fine. Our friends are full of love. Our bellies are full of sweet grass. We have no conflict, no desire. What would we even think to need? Hope is a feeling that arises when the world is broken, when tragedy is imminent, when the present is violated by potential futures beyond control. Hope comes from wanting things to be a way they are not. This is not a feeling we are familiar with.</p>

      <p>Before Aila found herself uncomfortably hoping that Sienna was safe, she had accepted the entirety of her situation as absolute. Now she understood that the future was not fixed. She was free, and that meant she had control over her own fate, not these evil men. She hoped she would prevail, and she hoped that these evil men would go away. And with that hope, she steeled herself.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s get this saddle on you, Horse. I know you understand me. Be good now, or see if I won&#8217;t break a couple of <em>your</em> ribs. Fair&#8217;s fair.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Fire</p>

      <p>The horse Willow was in his stable that night, mindlessly munching on alfalfa, when he developed a nagging feeling that something was wrong. He started thinking about Sienna and couldn&#8217;t shake the idea that she was in trouble.</p>

      <p>Now, I&#8217;m not a horse, but I think I can safely say that this was not a normal event for Willow. From what I&#8217;ve observed, horses, like most animals, live in the moment and tend not to think much about the parts of the world they are not experiencing. Maybe Willow was different in this respect, but if you were there to watch him like I was, you would have noticed a distinct and abrupt change in his behavior.</p>

      <p>He stopped eating, and began pacing back and forth in the confines of his pen. He nudged the loosely latched chest-height half doors that looked out to the paddock that Ander or the stable hands would open in the spring for fresh air. They rattled but did not open.</p>

      <p>He whinnied, panted, and paced, and he pawed at the straw on the ground. His agitation increased. He was worried about Sienna, and for the first time in his life he felt trapped.</p>

      <p>It was then that he smelled smoke. Far away at first, the smell quickly grew stronger. Soon it pervaded the air, which grew cloudy and grey. Willow felt the stable grow warmer, and when he saw the flicker of flames in the far hall, his agitation turned to panic.</p>

      <p>He reared at the closed window doors, and they rattled again but did not open. He turned and kicked them with his back legs and the doors flew open and off their hinges. He leapt out through the portal to the paddock and turned to face the stable, which he observed was consumed by a great fire. He ran to the fence that lined the road toward the castle and hopped it effortlessly. Many men were running into the stable and leading horses away towards the castle. He circled, panicked and unsure where to go. He saw many fires on both sides of the great city walls.</p>

      <p>At last he picked a direction where he saw no fire and bolted. I will say this: for a horse, he ran super super fast.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Gates</p>

      <p>Lilian Grays, and her son Jaylin smelled the wet smoke in the air miles before reaching Rothe. As they approached the town, their apprehension grew to dread. By the time they had reached the castle walls they had acclimated to the scene. The town was razed. Houses burnt, or burning. Black smoke filled the air. Their horses nickered as their anxiety grew.</p>

      <p>Lilian urged them to a fast trot. If they made it to the gates they would be fine. Thedlin would be there and everything would be fine. She just had to make it to the gates. Her mind held on to the thought as her knuckles turned white from gripping the reins. Make it to the gates.</p>

      <p>She heard horse steps behind them. She turned to look and saw three riders bearing down on them.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Jay, keep with me!&#8221; And they kicked their horses into a full gallop. They turned down onto the high road and raced against the rain and the smoke. Her horse jumped an overturned wagon in the road. Jay&#8217;s horse veered off to the right, and they crested a small hill that was a few hundred meters from the castle gates, with the riders gaining on them.</p>

      <p>Make it to the gates. And she did. They did. But the gates were blocked by an army of thirty men. Armed soldiers and horsemen blocked her every path.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Jay!&#8221; She turned her horse around his and eyed the three riders as they drew up. She drew a small sword from her saddle sheath, and waved it. She turned and looked at her young son, and holding back tears commanded him, &#8220;Ride, now. Don&#8217;t stop. Don&#8217;t ever stop.&#8221;</p>

      <p>She kicked her horse, hard, and leveled her sword out to her side. She kept Jay to her left and had to tug hard on her reins to keep her tame and gentle black horse racing towards her assailants. Her horse and sword collided with the rider farthest to her left, and Jaylyn managed to squeeze his horse out through the side between his mother and the stone wall of a burning building.</p>

      <p>Lilian fell from her horse to her back, winded by the flat side of the Aerenthian&#8217;s blade, and again by the fall. She gasped and struggled to breathe but couldn&#8217;t get air to her lungs. Her horse was in a crumpled mess with the soldier and his horse, but the other two riders circled around and dismounted. They pulled her to her feet but she resisted and would not stand or walk, so instead they dragged her, kicking and gasping, towards the gates and the Earl.</p>

      <p>They pushed through the ranks and arrived at a convening of the Earl and his commanders squared off by the Prince and his royal guard. The young prince was standing with his back to the keep, and was confronting the Earl. Though it was not clear what they were debating, it was apparent that they were in disagreement and that the mood was tense. Their arrival with the woman felt uncomfortable as the soldiers realized this matter was not of the importance they had imagined.</p>

      <p>The Earl and Prince paused their debate and contemplated the men and the captive woman.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Well? What&#8217;s this?&#8221; Riles was first to inquire.</p>

      <p>One soldier removed his helmet, and said, &#8220;We found her riding in from the east. She looks like royalty. She fled, but we captured her.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;She was alone?&#8221; Riles asked.</p>

      <p>&#8220;She was, Sir.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Riles and Prince Aden stared at the woman. Aden wondered to himself if this might be Lilian Grays, whom he had met long ago when he first met Sienna, at a festival here at Rothmew in another life. What would she be doing here, he wondered? And might she serve as a liaison of good faith between himself and King Reginald if he were to make peace with her?</p>

      <p>Riles on the other hand, saw her as a liability. He could kill her or imprison her, and he wanted to begin the side as soon as possible. He wanted to diffuse the prince&#8217;s objections as quickly as possible and get on with it.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Kill her.&#8221; He commanded the soldier.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Do not!&#8221; Aden commanded the soldier. He stepped forward and continued, &#8220;Release her to me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The soldier on Lilian&#8217;s left, drew his blade. The soldier to the right, helmless, released his grip on the woman&#8217;s wrist and stepped to one side.</p>

      <p>Aden drew his sword and held it firmly to the ground. He walked towards the woman and soldier, stopped abruptly, and said, &#8220;Do not make me repeat myself.&#8221;</p>

      <p>At this the soldier released his grip and shoved the woman to the ground before the prince.</p>

      <p>Riles was infuriated. Again the prince was opposing his command before his men. He could neither accept nor tolerate this. He drew his sword and strode forward.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill her myself then, bastard&#8221; He claimed as he moved to striking distance.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; Aden commanded.</p>

      <p>The Earl carried on as though he had not heard the command. He approached the woman prone on the ground and rose his great sword with both arms and thrust his killing blown downward.</p>

      <p><em>Klaaak</em>‌</p>

      <p>Aiden moved his short sword, swiftly intercepting Riles' assassination at the last moment. His blade deflected the great sword causing it to plunge point first into the ground.</p>

      <p>The men froze, and watched in anticipation as the prince stared down Riles. Lewlyn swept in at their feet and dragged the woman off to the side of the confrontation.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Riles, for high treason, in sight of the gods and our compatriots, I strip you of command. You are dismissed. Now draw or release your sword.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Riles spat at the prince, and sneered, &#8220;Fool. I&#8217;ll do neither. You do not command here, I do.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Riles turned to Keilan and waved him forward and yelled, &#8220;Take the prince!&#8221;</p>

      <p>Several horses turned as they obeyed, but Keilan held a hand to the air, and quietly uttered, &#8220;Halt.&#8221; And he backed his horse up a few steps, encouraging them to do the same.</p>

      <p>Riles' eyes flashed wide a moment, before drawing his sword from the ground.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Fine, I&#8217;ll do this myself, and then I&#8217;ll have your head,&#8221; he yelled to Keilan.</p>

      <p>The prince stood fast with his sword pointing straight to the earl.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I give you one last chance, traitor, though the premise has changed. You now face a life in chains or death here and now.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Riles, outraged, swung his sword in a powerful and fast overhead attack that would have devastated all but the best defenders. Aden qualified. He stepped gracefully to one side, flipped his sword in his hand, and thrust sideways as Riles completed his arc. Aden&#8217;s sword tip found purchase between the commander&#8217;s plate armor where it was attached at his side, and the prince jerked his sword in and angled it towards Riles' belly as he xwithdrew it.</p>

      <p>Riles toppled to his knees, and the prince thrust his sword into the back of the slain commander&#8217;s neck to finish the job.</p>

      <p>He reached down, rolled the man&#8217;s corpse over and pulled the golden griffon pin from his neck and ripped the red cloak from his shoulders, which he used to clean his sword. He then turned to face the army, and saw Keilan nod at him.</p>

      <p>He tossed him the pin and yelled, &#8220;Keilan, you are now my Earl Marshal.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Keilan nodded his assent, and spoke loudly so the men would hear. &#8220;Thank you, Your Highness. You honor me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Good. Now command the ranks to station the west wall. We are here to defend our fair sister Rothe from the ravaging Kells. Do you object?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Your grace. I do not.&#8221;</p>

      <p>He spoke markedly quieter then, as he added, &#8220;And, well done, Prince.&#8221; And at that he clapped slowly. Many men clapped, and for a moment the prince was happy.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Sun</p>

      <p>Willow ran through the night until his coat glistened with sweat and reflected the morning sunrise. Then he walked, and caught his breath, and nibbled at some grass for a spell. And then he ran some more. He didn&#8217;t know where he was going, but the sun rose at his back, and caught up with him by midday, and he followed it into the evening until clouds rolled in. It felt good to follow the sun, he thought, and he missed it when it retired for the evening.</p>

      <p>When he noticed his exhaustion mounting, he would stop and walk a while. When he tired, he napped for a bit. Mostly, he thought about Sienna, and wondered where she was.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Reunion</p>

      <p>Jivan, Talmund, and Sienna hiked for several hours up Blinken’s Path. It was an arduous trek, but the promise of a warm meal and soft bed at an inn once they reached Klosser kept them motivated. The exertion warmed Talmund and the princess, but also exacerbated their bruises from their jaunt in the Whiteheel river. When they at last reached the small trading town of Klosser, they were tired, sore, and in foul but optimistic spirits.</p>

      <p>That was before they discovered that the town had been razed days or weeks ago. Once they realized their hopes had been folly, their moods ranged from utterly dour to simply miserable.</p>

      <p>Jivan took it as a personal failure. As they mulled through the destroyed and desolate town, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Princess, I should have scouted ahead.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna was depleted, and she thought to rebuke him. He <em>should</em> have scouted ahead. He was, after all, a scout, was he not? But she bit her tongue, and instead sought to sooth his worry.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Certainly this is not your fault, Jivan.&#8221;</p>

      <p>He felt her tentative kindness, and went on. &#8220;I should not have got our hopes up. I did not think the Kells had been raiding this far south.&#8221;</p>

      <p>She couldn&#8217;t help herself, she realized. &#8220;Raiding? Jivan, if this is what you consider a raid I would hate to hear you describe a razing.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Your highness, of course. Poor word choice on my part. They have destroyed this place. Still, I think we should leave directly. I do not like being exposed like this.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Talmund looked lost in as they continued walking through the leveled town, &#8220;Where now?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Jivan pointed to the east, up a slight hill where the spire of a Church of Farro still stood, though the statue of the great horse was mostly burnt and missing. Still, the rearing head and one extended hoof remained intact to mark their way.</p>

      <p>&#8220;There, the Dakgne Forest. Two, maybe three days on foot. Good hunting. We can follow the Swallowcreek river, or, Princess Sienna, if you prefer, we can steer well clear of it.&#8221; He threw the princess a wry smirk, and when the princess laughed and threw a piece of jerky at him, his smirk grew into a smile, and he was pleased with his delayed rebuttal.</p>

      <p>But then the princess' expression fell from her face, and her eyes went vacant, and Jivan and Talmund stared as she ran as fast as she could up the slight hill towards the old church. The two men again traded confused glances, and each sighed briefly before they ran after her.</p>

      <p>When she reached the top of the hill, Willow was but a few of his long galloping paces away, and he met her there, in front of that house of Farro&#8217;s.</p>

      <p>Sienna cried out, &#8220;Willie! You came! You found me!&#8221; And she hugged him, and he was sopping wet, and hot to the touch. He snorted and neighed, and he panted as he stared at the two men running towards him. He stepped past Sienna, and furrowed his brow, dropped his ears, and flared his nostrils as he roared out a nasty neigh, and the two men slowed and then stopped as they neared.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Willow, these are my friends! Talmund and Jivan! Tal, Jivan, say hello to Willow.&#8221;</p>

      <p>And she leaned in a bit and said furtively, &#8220;He can understand you, but he can&#8217;t speak Human like Aila can.&#8221;</p>

      <p>For the third time that day, the two men exchanged an exasperated glance.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Clearing</p>

      <p>Willow&#2019;s ears dropped, and he snorted at the group.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What is it boy?&#8221; Sienna asked.</p>

      <p>Willow snorted again, stopped his hoof, and cranked his head to the north.</p>

      <p>Jivan surveyed the area, and abruptly said, &#8220;We have to go. Now. Run!&#8221;</p>

      <p>The others complied, and once out of town, they made their way into the hemlock forest via an ill used but wide path lined with blackberries and ivy, and ferns, and trillium, and a rhododendron that was beginning to bud glorious red blossoms, and fallen logs covered with moss, and huckleberry bushes, and&#8230; and I&#8217;m sorry. I keep doing this. Eranor always tells me to &#8216;Get to the point already&#8217;, and &#8216;stop naming all the bushes!&#8217; I know I can be awful about it, I just want to tell you about all the different wonderful things that surrounded them. The forest was beautiful as the foliage was waking up with the spring. The cool shade was welcome after the dry hot sun that had beat on them in the abandoned town.</p>

      <p>They came to a clearing with a clear, shallow creek of rapidly flowing water, and Willow drank heartily and then lay down clumsily on his side and panted. Jivan refilled his water bags and scoured the area until he found a large flat section of bark.</p>

      <p>Sienna sat and caressed Willow&#8217;s neck and ears, which she knew he loved.</p>

      <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s exhausted.&#8221; Jivan said. &#8220;And overheated.&#8221; He raised his water skin as he walked over to the horse, and then thoroughly doused him. He then used the piece of wood to scrape the water off the animals hide.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; Talmund asked.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Trying to cool him off.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Talmund watched as Jivan worked and followed up,&#8220;But why are you taking all the water off?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t scrape it off, the water will sit on the surface and make things worse.&#8221;</p>

      <p>When he had finished wiping down Willow&#8217;s side, he took a second water skin and doused him again, and he again scraped it off.</p>

      <p>&#8220;We should get him to his feet. We need to get deeper into the forest.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna looked up at Jivan appreciatively and said, &#8220;Yes sir, right away sir,&#8221; and they both smiled faintly.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Come on Willy, I know you&#8217;re tired but we have to go. I don&#8217;t know why but Captain Jivan says so.&#8221;</p>

      <p>As Willow rose, Jivan replied. &#8220;Kells. There were 10 of them heading our way. If your horse hadn&#8217;t alerted us we&#8217;d be in chains or worse by now.&#8221; He paused, then added, &#8220;&#8230;And I&#8217;m just a scout, Ma&#8217;am, no captain.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna turned to him and her face grew stern. &#8220;You used to be a scout, Jivan. But if I am a princess, then you are a captain. Unless there is something better than captain? I should have paid more attention to my father when he taught me about such things. Unless you&#8217;d rather remain a scout, of course.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Your highness, you honor me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;By my count, Jivan, thrice you have saved me, or played a hand in doing so. I cannot honor you enough. When we are home and things are back to normal I&#8217;ll speak with my&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <p>The princess trailed off, and neither Jivan nor Talmund knew what to say. Jivan rooted in his pack and found a bag of dried oats, which he fed Willow by hand.</p>

      <p>When he was done and faced the group, he knew the princess had made a decision.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Jivan, Tal. I am grateful for you both, in so many ways. But now that Willow has found me, I must go. I have to find Aila.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Talmund was dumbstruck. &#8220;What? You&#8217;re leaving?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m afraid so. She&#8217;s in trouble Tal. I have to find her. And then I must make haste to the keep.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;But how do you know she&#8217;s in trouble?&#8221; Talmund asked. &#8220;She could be anywhere.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I just know. I saw her before I fell into the river. Well, I saw what she saw. She was surrounded by Kells, and they shot her with arrows, and then I don&#8217;t know what happened but she&#8217;s gone now. And I have to find her.&#8221; The princess' voice was wavy as she held back tears.</p>

      <p>Talmund persisted. &#8220;If she&#8217;s been captured by the Kells, then you can&#8217;t go alone! You&#8217;re the princess; if they capture you then all is lost. Sienna, think on this. I will go for Aila. Tell me where she is.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Jivan added, &#8220;Talmund makes sense, your highness. Truthfully you should return to the castle, though I doubt that way is safe either. The Kells will not have reached Rothmew yet, but their scouts certainly have. We should stay together, I think.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna pondered a moment, then replied. &#8220;Thank you for your counsel, sage advice. Wise words. But Aila is in trouble and I shan&#8217;t abandon her. It&#8217;s my fault. And she would come for me, I know that. I can&#8217;t leave her.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Jivan sighed. He looked to trade glances with Talmund, but the scribe&#8217;s attention was locked on the princess. He made a decision, and hoped he wouldn&#8217;t regret it as he pronounced, &#8220;I will find her, Princess. By my sword, by the king, and by my word, I will find her and return her to you. You, however, must take Talmund. Willow can carry the both of you; he is a fine steed. But you must ride to Rothmew. Talmund, I know I need not say this, but you must protect the princess with your life.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Sienna&#8221;, he broke protocol for dramatic effect, &#8220;Just as you know Aila is in trouble, I know you must return to the keep. They will need you.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna finally cried. Well, tears ran out of her eyes, and down her cheeks, and down her neck, but she didn&#8217;t make a sound. She nodded slowly, and mounted her old friend Willow, who was feeling much better after his drink and respite, brief though it was. He was happy he had found Sienna, and overjoyed that she was well.</p>

      <p>Talmund awkwardly climbed up behind Sienna, and the three of them turned to leave Jivan alone there on the edge of the Dakgne Forest.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Head due east. No fires. Swallowcreek to the south if you find no other water. Ride swiftly, but stealthily. Trust Willow&#8217;s vision. Sleep in shifts.&#8221;</p>

      <p>He was talking to himself by the end, but for some reason the advice he offered &#2013; albeit too slowly &#2013; comforted him.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Bad Man</p>

      <p>In the morning they fed her rotten hay, and Aila was hungry enough that she ate it. A boy she had not seen before brought it to her pole, and he stood back from her and said, &#8220;You are a pretty horse, aren&#8217;t you&#8221;.</p>

      <p>Aila was hurt and tired, and she replied, &#8220;I am not a horse&#8221;, and the boy turned and ran away.</p>

      <p>She picked through the hay, and though it was not enough to fill her belly, and though it tasted sour and moldy, she was still glad for it. Her body ached. Her flank was not healing and exposed tissues stung in the open air. Her shoulders were sore from the straps that bound her wings to her body, and beneath it all, her heart ached. She longed for her freedom.</p>

      <p>The sun rose, and the camp rose with it and soon there was activity everywhere as men tore down tents and packed wagons and readied their horses.</p>

      <p>Krenn returned, and he affixed a leather bag to her head that was filled with grain that she ate gratefully. Meanwhile he brushed her hide with a coarse brush, and it felt nice though it hurt in places.</p>

      <p>Then a smaller man dressed in black and red armor came, and even from a distance Aila grew anxious. At ten paces she recognized the man as the one who had stabbed the king. At five paces she smelled the foul odors of alcohol and sweat and rotten meat.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Krenn. Is she ready, then?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aye, she&#8217;ll do, your majesty. As told, she&#8217;s still wild. Nearly killed Bilken last night, the beast did. She&#8217;s got spirit. Ain&#8217;t trained like you&#8217;re used to, but she&#8217;ll ride.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Krenn extended his riding crop to his king, but Korvas sneered, lifted a heel, and tapped at the triangular spurs at his heel.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll be needing that&#8221;, he said. &#8220;Get her dressed.&#8221; With that, he lifted himself into the saddle on Aila&#8217;s back. He was light, and incredibly nimble. One moment he stood at her side, and the next he was maneuvering his metal boots in the stirrups that dangled from her saddle.</p>

      <p>Krenn released the bindings from her head, and for a moment her mouth was free. She yawned, and stretched her jaw, but the reprieve was short lived, as Krenn jammed a metal bar into the back of her mouth, and latched new leather straps through buckles at her neck. She twisted her jaw and pushed at the bar with her tongue but the straps held it place, and she found that it was not intolerable when she didn&#8217;t fight it.</p>

      <p>Korvas pulled on ropes that were attached to the bar somehow, and the metal bit tugged into her mouth in a most uncomfortable way. She moved her head back and to one side to release the pressure.</p>

      <p>Korvas, pulling on the reins, looked down into the unicorns eyes. &#8220;They say you can talk, Unicorn. Tell me then &#2013; what is your name?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aila was startled that the man recognized her as something other than a horse. She contemplated her options, and she felt the safest course of action was be to remain quiet. But her inner voice compelled her to break the languorous tension.</p>

      <p>&#8220;My name is Aila. And I already know you, Korvas Kell. You are a bad man.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Korvas laughed in delight, and the sound terrified her. He tugged tighter on the reins, pulling Aila&#8217;s head closer to his own, and he replied, &#8220;Yes! Right! I am pleased that we understand each other. Certainly we will get along just fine.&#8221;</p>

      <p>And then he released the tension on the reins and pat Aila&#8217;s neck. As his hand made contact with her, she felt a shock course through her body as she became aware of every foul deed he had ever performed. Shock turned to abject horror and disgust, and she nearly toppled over and had to focus to keep her legs beneath her.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go for a ride now, shall we?&#8221; Korvas then gave Aila a light kick with his heels, and the spurs dug into her side near her waist. The pain was intense, and Aila leapt in surprise. He spurred her on again, and soon she was galloping. When she would slow down, he would kick her. When he wanted to go one way or the other, he would tug on her reins and pull her to that direction. Bound as she was, she saw no point in resisting, and found that the ride was most tolerable when she abandoned her will and responded quickly to his signals.</p>

      <p>They rode for several hours, and with time and familiarity, foregoing her own will grew easier, and his commands became less brutal. Aila noticed at one point that they were being followed by a group of men on horses, dressed in black. This must be his guard, she thought. They kept their distance, and only compounded her lassitude.</p>

      <p>Korvas tried to strike up conversation at several points, but Aila did not respond. This did not appear to bother Korvas.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Where did you come from, Unicorn?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;You are quite agile, aren&#8217;t you.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Which way shall we go now, girl?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Eventually they returned to the army, which had mobilized and was marching east, presumably towards Rothe. Korvas and Aila fell in towards the rear of the mass of troops. Their arrival was met with much enthusiasm. His men admired his new steed, and he was offered many compliments.</p>

      <p>Surrounded by coarse and wicked men on beaten horses, marching towards an unknown but horrid fate, Aila felt more alone than she had in a hundred years, since before she was born.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Princess&#8217;s Return</p>

      <p>Sienna and Talmund rode Willow slowly through the Dakgne woods. They spoke little, and slept less. Willow grazed on rare clusters of tall grass that were sprinkled throughout the forest floor during the early hours, and though he was never sated, his energy returned with their leisurely pace.</p>

      <p>They tracked the Swallowcreek river as they headed east, and it was clear and cold and refreshing each time they stopped or made camp. Talmund enjoyed this time with Sienna, and though the anxiety about their return was ever-present, he rejoiced in sharing moments with her, such as when the warm sun would suddenly break through the trees after a long trek through the shade, or when the trees would fully break and expose the glory of the Rothian foothills. At one such vista, the tall spires of Egris and Gaia we&#8217;ve visible in the distance to the west, and while admiring them an eagle soared by and screeched.</p>

      <p>His favorite times were riding Willow. They had started with him riding behind Sienna, but had determined that it was much more comfortable for both of them with Talmund up front. The princess would wrap her arms around him for support, and at times she would rest her cheek on his back and relax. She once fell asleep in this position, and when Talmund realized it, he held her thigh with his right hand to make sure she wouldn&#8217;t slip. They rode for hours like this, and though he was unaware, they held the position long after Sienna awoke.</p>

      <p>For her part, she had grown quite fond of Talmund. For some reason she had always been able to talk to him, and had always felt a warmth and gentleness from him that comforted her. She was growing to consider him a friend, and was glad for his companionship. Willow was additional comfort, though not much for conversation without Aila around.</p>

      <p>Her anxiety for her friend ignited every time she thought about Aila, and inevitably whenever she tried to put the unicorn out of her mind she would think about Rothmew &#2013; her home &#2013; and then her father, which initiated a new cycle of worry.</p>

      <p>They rode out early on the third morning of their journey. The sun was only beginning to rise, but the birds were already chattering. The forest loosened and soon they were in the open air, watching the sunrise before them making delicate pink and golden intimations of the day.</p>

      <p>As they descended into the fertile farmland south of the keep, they saw that disaster had already found their home. Large swaths of land was burning or blackened. There were plumes of gray smoke in the air. From the distance it was indecipherable, but it was clear that the city was under siege. The Kells must have arrived.</p>

      <p>&#8220;The stables.&#8221; Sienna whispered.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What? What about them?&#8221; Talmund asked.</p>

      <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gone. Razed.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Willow slowed to a walk, and then stopped altogether.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; The princess asked. Despair overwhelmed her. She&#8217;d known it was only a fool&#8217;s hope, but a part of her had imagined that they would simply ride into town and through the bannered gates, and into the keep, and that all would be well. Now, confronted with the grim reality of disaster, she was hollow and defeated.</p>

      <p>&#8220;We will have to go around. We certainly cannot get to the keep from here. From the looks of it, the Kells are at the south gates, which makes sense from a strategic perspective. Logistics from the north make for a much more challenged attack due to the more rugged terrain. Perhaps if we circle around, a way into the keep will present itself.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna nodded, and they proceeded.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Night Scout</p>

      <p>Jivan caught up with the Kells shortly after Sienna and Talmund departed astride the princess' faithful horse, Willow. He had doubled back towards Klosser and tracked the scouting group that had nearly ambushed them back north to the High Road. He was in his bailiwick tailing them from a distance, staying close but hidden. His mind was blank. His feet intuitively avoided dry twigs and loose stones, and he was silent.</p>

      <p>By nightfall, they had reached the crossroads where Cheynl met the West Road, and there the Kell scouts reunited with the bulk of the Kells army. Jivan spent the gloaming hours circling and surveying the enemy camp, reconnoitering their forces and arrangement, prowling close through bushes and undergrowth, and climbing bluffs and more jagged slopes to the north for broader vantages.</p>

      <p>By the darkness of the moonless cloud covered sky, he had identified the stables, and the royal quarters. But though his night eyes served him well and his stealth tenebrosity brought him near, he could not find Aila. He spent the night hunting fruitlessly.</p>

      <p>Unavailing and defeated, he dozed lightly through the early hours of dawn. When the full light of day began to warm the ground and some early risers made their rounds, Jivan saw Aila at once, standing motionless, hitched to a heavy post near Korvas' large red royal tent. He nearly broke his cover berating himself. He had scoped out that tent several times from all directions, but he had not expected the unicorn to have been painted black.</p>

      <p>Damn. The Kells would likely make Rothemew by day&#8217;s end. His best opportunity for recouping the animal had come and gone.</p>

      <p>A long, low pitch of a horn reverberated throughout the camp, and the sea of tents came down in minutes. Shortly after, Korvas emerged from his tent. He mounted Aila, issued some commands, and the army was marching swiftly towards Rothe.</p>

      <p>Jivan scouted from ahead and behind. He exhausted himself racing around the marching army, and though they stopped several times along the way, he never did. And he never had anything close to another opportunity to get near to Aila that day.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Parley</p>

      <p>Eleven hundred men.</p>

      <p>Thedlin and Vots were in the king&#8217;s study discussing tactics as they had done for three nights past. The bird from the south had alerted them to the arrival of two thousand Aerenthians the night prior, and they had rejoiced at the news, for they believed help was on the way. But that hope had vanished this morning, consumed by the fires that surrounded the town.</p>

      <p>One hundred bows, including thirty longbowmen. Six hundred infantry. One hundred pikes. Fifty royal guards. Two hundred and fifty townsmen armed with picks and hoes.</p>

      <p>They played scenarios out for each other for hours, and at one point Thedlin broke out in laughter. &#8220;This is pointless, Vots! We may as well be boys playing with toy horses.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aye&#8221;, Vots replied. &#8220;We may as well. We have little recourse here. Our every move is retaliatory. Until they lay siege we must wait.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Thedlin&#8217;s laughter eroded his facade and left him grave. &#8220;If only Egner were here to offer up surrender. And perhaps he would be right for once. I now fear we are doomed. And what of Agien? What would Aggie say, Vots? What of Nallo? Damn this, Nathan! Have we lived fifty years to be squashed like spiders? In our own home? Here now, in this moment, are we to just wait for the thumb?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the metaphor, Thed. We wait, but not for our doom, but for a moment. An opportunity. An advantage. Our doom may fall upon us, but I will not lie down in defeat before it comes.&#8221;</p>

      <p>A knock on the large wooden doors interrupted the moment, and Gregor entered.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Sirs, the Aerentians. Their emissary has arrived. Prince Aden as well. They wish to parley.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;And Sir&#8230;&#8221; Gregor quietly put a small scroll out to Thedlin&#8217;s hand. &#8220;They have Lilian.&#8221;</p>

      <p>The three men stormed onto the courtyard, armored and ready for a fight. Forty guards marched behind them with long polearms, each adorned with a long diamond shaped blade and two shorter angled prongs. They passed through the castle gates, and met the Aerenthians at the outermost gates of the curtain wall. As the great iron doors slid open to either side and the portcullis lifted, Thedlin saw first the prince of Aerenthal and second, his wife. He raised his left hand and motioned the guards forward with a flick of his two fingers. They marched out on either side in two columns and encircled the visitors.</p>

      <p>Thedlin raised an eyebrow to Vots. Perhaps this was an opportunity. Perhaps an advantage. He stepped forward.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You come alone. Release her to me and you may live, Prince.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aden opened his hands and presented them to Thedlin palms up. &#8220;My lord, she is free. I have come to aid Rothelyn&#8217;s plight against the Kells, though I admit it must appear otherwise. Forgive my men for the destruction of this fair city &#2013; they were acting on orders not my own. I would very much like to speak with the king.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Lilian, upon seeing her husband, ran to him and clutched him in her arms. She spoke now.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Thedlin. It&#8217;s Jay. He&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Vots broke character and issued a command. &#8220;Come, all of you. We have much to discuss.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Return</p>

      <p>[TODO: insert map of town, curtain wall, keep]</p>

      <p>Willow, Talmund, and Sienna reached the eastern slopes of Rothe, where the terrain rose and provided them with clear vistas of Rothe, the meandering curtain wall which divided the sprawling town in two, and in the center of it all, Rothmew, the great keep. Many of the buildings outside the curtain were smoldering. Large swaths of the town were leveled and reduced to crude black smears. What caught their attention, however, was the slow procession of troops leading into the inner city through the south gates.</p>

      <p>&#8220;They aren&#8217;t Kells.&#8221; Talmund said.</p>

      <p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Sienna asked, confused.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Kells wear black. These men are in silver armor, and I can&#8217;t make out the sigil, but they fly dark banners. It may be Aerenthal&#8217;s rose.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Aerenthal? Truly? Aden did this?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s possible. I couldn&#8217;t say. There, look, I do think that is a rose. But Senn, the gates are wide open. I cannot fathom why the gates would be open. Surely Thedlin would not surrender so readily. Aerentahal may have sent aid after all.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna got excited. &#8220;If they have, then we may have a hope after all. Tal, we must get inside.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Wait, we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s really happening. Let&#8217;s wait until the troops are in and then scout out the gates. With any luck we&#8217;ll recognize the gatekeep.&#8221;</p>

      <p>They rode carefully down into the town, through what felt like a charred carcass of a city, and hid out in the rubble of a burned building near the main gates until the troops had passed. And they were in luck. Simon, the old guard who had manned the gates for years let them in, and he provided an escort into the keep.</p>

      <p>The stable master, Ander, met them in the courtyard, and Willow went with him after the princess gave him a long and loving goodby, and after she insisted that he get a good brushing and the best alfalfa and oats.</p>

      <p>Though she was elated to be home, Sienna felt anxious, nervous, and hollow. She would feel this way until she was reunited with Aila, but she did not know when that would be.</p>

      <p>Talmund also felt anxious, nervous, and hollow, but for entirely different reasons. He knew that his time with Sienna was coming to an end, and with each step towards the castle he felt his own agency diminish.</p>

      <p>As they passed into the courtyard through the great arched entrance, his anxiety rose. His face grew hot. He knew that he was about to do something stupid, and yet he found that he could not stop himself.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Sienna&#8230;&#8221; He took her hand and gently turned her to face him, and they paused in their walk.</p>

      <p>Before she could say, &#8216;What is it?&#8217;, he told her what it was.</p>

      <p>&#8220;All this time&#8230; I&#8217;m in love you.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Sienna blinked three times in quick succession. Her face was blank as she looked at him. His face, on the other hand, looked like a knotted up shirt someone had left under the bed.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I just want you to know, before&#8230;&#8221; He looked over to the keep. &#8220;Everything is about to change. I might not ever get another chance to tell you.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Before he has spoken, he had felt a foreboding but he had not been prepared for her reaction. Her eyes narrowed, and Talmund felt her hostility.</p>

      <p>She spoke slowly, and quietly, and said only, &#8220;Damn you, Talmund.&#8221;</p>



      <p className="section-title">IV: The Battle of Men</p>
      <p className="section-title">Rothmew Keep</p>

      <p>Sienna stood atop the westernmost merlon as the early morning sun cast a faint pink glow across the stirring sky. Alone on the west tower, her white gown flowing in the wind, she looked out at the peaks of Egris and Gaia and the mountains beyond. She studied the way the sun illuminated some parts of the foothills while others were still shrouded in shadow, unawakened yet by the sun. She watched a family of geese swim across the sky, and she noticed the fluffy white clouds glowing cheerfully in the distance.</p>

      <p>And she thought, &#8216;Isn&#8217;t this picturesque. What a lovely day&#8217;.</p>

      <p>The geese reminded her of Aila. Everything did that, though, so it barely distracted her from her ruminations. She worried over her father. She had sat with him several times over the past two days since her return. When she first saw him, she had embraced him and cried on his chest until she noticed that the scar on his throat pulsed with a gently pink light. Curious, she had touched it with her finger, and it glowed momentarily before fading. She had been unable to reproduce the effect in her subsequent visits, but that image of the seven pointed star haunted her.</p>

      <p>She looked out over the Dakgne Forest, and imagined the path she and Talmund and Jivan had taken from the mountains in the distance.</p>

      <p>She absentmindedly traced her own scar with the tip of her ring finger. There was no wrinkle of the skin where it sat, and the texture was quite natural, yet she could still feel it. It wasn&#8217;t like any other scar. If anything, the tissue actually felt softer - as though instead of the skin&#8217;s surface she could feel deeper into her insides. Or rather, it was as though her insides there could feel the touch of her finger.</p>

      <p>It had been difficult seeing Aden again. Unexpected. She had encountered him nearly immediately after entering the castle. He was in the study with Thedlin and Vots when she had burst in. And mere moments after she had listened to Talmund declare his love for her, she was assailed by her former love, Aden, as he issued a similar pronouncement.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Princess, my love! Where have you been? I have been fretting, since Thedlin told me you had vanished and your father returned by way of flying horse. And under the mighty fist of the Kells, no less! These are no faint circumstances. But, fear not. I have, by my own command, risen against my father&#8217;s biding, and pledged my entire force, more than half of the Aerenthian army, to your cause, and for the salvation of Rothe&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <p>He finally noticed her stricken face, and gave pause. &#8220;Sienna, I do apologize for not writing. I do love you. I am forever yours, and you are ever in my heart.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Aghast and exasperated, Sienna simply stated, &#8220;She is not a horse.&#8221; And she may have slightly slammed the door as she left the room.</p>

      <p>Since then, Aden had sent seven missives and invitations, and Sienna had asked poor Bee to excuse each of them. Impinged upon and resentful for it, she felt no compulsion to reply. But the messages were a nuisance. Aden clearly wanted to see her, but surely one message was enough. Seven? It was insulting. And though she did not love him anymore, she did not want to hurt him. She had come to pity him. His world was so small and predetermined that he couldn&#8217;t even see her. He didn&#8217;t even know how magical she was. She had seen that the second he had started talking &#2013; it was as though he&#8217;d been reading the words, or had memorized a script for a play she had no part in. He just wanted to have her. Like a horse.</p>

      <p>Not like Talmund. Damn, she was still mad at him. She had been convinced that they were becoming friends, and she had felt so comfortable in his company. Dammit, why did men have to ruin everything? At least Talmund had only sent one message, and he had waited until this morning to deliver it.</p>

      <p>She took out the small letter, and tore it open. The writing was strong and elegant, black ink on luxurious smooth cream paper.</p>

      <p>It read:</p>

      <p>Sienna,
      Please forgive me. Your friendship is my world; it means everything. I should never have said anything to endanger it.
      I am heading out to try to find a friend.
      Wish me luck?
      Tal</p>

      <p>She let the wind take the note. It lifted out of her fingers as if it were a moth and flew away.</p>

      <p>Sienna lowered her gaze and watched as the two opposing seas of Kells and Aerenthians in the valley below collided in battle.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Kell&#8217;s</p>

      <p>I won&#8217;t go into much detail here of the battle outside the gates of Rothmew. It was utter carnage that I don&#8217;t have words for. It was a horrific battle. In the world of Men there are many songs of battle, and poems, works of literature, and paintings. I know not how these things emerge. How can Men possibly be inspired to create such works of beauty by these terrible events? I myself was inspired only to despair. To mourn.</p>

      <p>But I must at least tell you what happened to those we care about. Perhaps this is how it always is. The things that are bigger than us reverberate through the ones we love.</p>

      <p>The Aerenthian infantry, led by the recently appointed Marshal Keilan, met the Kells as they forged into the Valley to the west of the keep. Arrows marred the sky as swordsmen slashed each other. Thousands died.</p>

      <p>By mid-afternoon, the field had thinned down to a tired chaos, and Aden rode out with the cavalry and his royal guard. His captains, Jamlyn and Lewlyn led their charge. The Kells sent their own horses out to meet them. Few survived. Riderless horses sensibly fled the scene as opportunity provided. Jamlyn fell, defeated by lance. Aden, Lewlyn, and six other riders returned to the curtain late in the day.</p>

      <p>A dull quietude emerged. A few small skirmishes lingered as the day languished. And then a thousand fresh men crested the foothills as they approached the city walls. Korvas Kell had taken the field leading his own royal guard. He rode astride a menacing black unicorn with a red stripe painted down the center of her face.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The King&#8217;s Revival</p>

      <p>King Reginald woke from a nightmare drenched in sweat. He sat up, and yelled for his chambermaid. There was no response. He rose and dressed himself, and splashed water on his face, then plunged his whole head into the basin and held it there until bubbles of his breath emerged. He stumbled down the hall to the sitting room and donned his chest plate, not bothering to attempt lacing the long side straps. He latched his longsword to his hip before exiting the room.</p>

      <p>The guards outside the King&#8217;s chambers were surprised to see their king emerge. Reginald issued orders for one to find Thedlin and the other to rally the King&#8217;s guard, and they both ran off.</p>

      <p>He saw Bee as she was traversing the great hall towards the kitchens.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Bee! What is happening? Where is everybody?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Your highness! You&#8217;re up! Are you well?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Where is everyone?&#8221; The king&#8217;s temper was high and his sharp tone frightened the maid.</p>

      <p>&#8220;My Lord, there is a battle outside. The Kells are at our door.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Sienna?&#8221; He asked.</p>

      <p>&#8220;She is well my king. In her quarters last I saw her.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Good. I have dreamed this. Run for her, Bee. You might think me mad, but I have seen this. She must join me on the field. We must rescue a unicorn! That unicorn is our salvation.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Yes my lord! Aila? Have you seen Aila?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;You know of her?&#8221; The king was astonished.</p>

      <p>&#8220;She brought you here my Lord. She flew off after bringing you back from the field.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Go, Bee. Waste no more time. Bring Sienna to the gates.&#8221;</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Princess&#8217; Charge</p>

      <p>Sienna was not in her quarters. Bee&#8217;s mission evolved into finding her, and she failed. She searched the entire keep, but the princess was not to be found, for she had already left the castle. She had donned her own armor and helm, and taken a lance from the armory. She mounted Willow and rode out to find Aila, whom she had seen taking the field from her perch atop the tower crenelations.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Broken Cart</p>

      <p>Talmund was a scribe by birthright and tutelage, but he had a sword, and he had been trained in the basics. He would never be a knight, he knew, but he could swing. Keep your blade up. Parry, deflect, strike. He had never been in an honest fight before, but today he had taken the field in search of a unicorn. Foolish.</p>

      <p>He was stealthy for much of the day. He had exited the keep early in the morning and had kept to the south as he tried to make sense of the various armies. He watched as the main battle took place from a distance. He had identified the Kells royal guard and contingency forces late in the afternoon when he was ambushed by four roving infantrymen. He would have died if they weren&#8217;t already injured and tired from the day&#8217;s battle. He ran, and they followed, but he evaded them.</p>

      <p>He ran the wrong way, though, and it was then that he found himself in his first real sword fight. He parried, and he deflected as his barbarous opponent savagely hurled blow after blow at him with his broadsword. After the enemy&#8217;s fifth attack, something changed in him, and Talmund the boy was transfigured into Talmund the man.</p>

      <p>Parry. Deflect. <em>Strike</em>.</p>

      <p>He ducked his opponents broad horizontal attack and rose tall, his short sword extended to his side. His face dropped all indications of exasperation and fear as he furrowed his eyebrows and frowned. Time slowed. He studied the man across from him. His body was twisting away from him as he completed his strike. His plate armor had openings at his shoulder, but chainmail beneath protected him there. But the mail below the Kell&#8217;s chest plate at his waist was short, and he saw grey cloth. And in that same moment, Talmund stepped forward and watched as his sword plunged into the side of the man&#8217;s torso. There was no resistance. The hilt of his blade struck the metal of the soldier&#8217;s armor, and Talmund drew it back out just as swiftly. He pushed the man with his free hand in the process, and he fell, gasping, clutching at his wound.</p>

      <p>Talmund ran on.</p>

      <p>He killed seven others in the next hour as he stumbled across the battlefield. He killed three more before seeing Aila. She was racing towards him, dressed in black, and flanked by a sea of war horses.</p>

      <p>If Jivan hadn&#8217;t been there to push him to the ground and cover them with the broken remains of a war cart, he surely would have been trampled.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Open Field</p>

      <p>Sienna and Willow dashed out the curtain wall gates and nearly collided into the remnants of Aden&#8217;s army. Hemmed in by a swarm of meandering men on horseback and on foot, she slowly made her way forward to where she saw the flying green and blue banners of Aerenthal and Rothe. As she neared the front lines, she saw Aden, and his friend Lewlyn beside Thedlin and Vots. Wanting to avoid an encounter, she shuffled to her right, but she became blocked by a double line of pikemen moving into position.</p>

      <p>Annoyed and agitated, she fought against the current of the troop&#8217;s formation and tried to find an opening to push through. She made her way up the wide and low stairs of a city building and was provided the vantage to see that the troops she&#8217;d been fighting were the King&#8217;s own guard. Emerging from the curtain wall behind her was the king.</p>

      <p>Her father was waving his sword and pushing his horse to a gallup. Legions of men we doing their best to keep formation around him.</p>

      <p>When Sienna saw this, she kicked Willow into gear and pushed her way through the horses and men in her way. I say she kicked, but that&#8217;s just because &#8216;she bumped him with her heel&#8217; doesn&#8217;t have the same dramatic effect. She was not hurting the horse, just giving him a nudge to let him know she wanted to go faster. He didn&#8217;t mind.</p>

      <p>She kicked him again as they crashed through the bannermen and broke through to the open battlefield at a gallup.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The King&#8217;s Cry</p>

      <p>Aden was momentarily nonplused by the sight of the princess riding out to face the oncoming enemy alone, but his instincts took over and he kicked his own horse into action. He raced forth to catch up with Sienna before she met the wave of fast approaching horsemen. Lewlyn snapped his reins and followed but paces behind.</p>

      <p>Behind him, Thedlin and Vots motioned to their men. Banners waved dramatically from side to side. Thus the Rothian calvary surged forward.</p>

      <p>Behind them, the king in a battle rage, fresh from his deathbed, raced astride his black horse Abi. He waved his sword menacingly forward, and yelling, &#8220;For Ailaaaa! For Rothelyyyyynnne!&#8221;</p>

      <p>And behind the king, one hundred and fifty blue and silver-garbed soldiers of the Royal Guard, polearms wagging in the air as they ran to catch up. One hundred and fifty three, if you&#8217;re counting.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Joust</p>

      <p>Korvas sneered. Riding forward astride Aila in full attack mode woke a part of his spirit that truly loved living. The beast supporting him ran fast and gracefully; her pace was smooth and he imagined that he was a javelin propelled frictionless towards its target. Steadied against the gallop&#8217;s rhythmic undulation by his legs, he inhaled deeply and smiled deeper as the keep ahead of him grew larger and larger in his field of vision, and the soldiers before it took up more and more of his attention.</p>

      <p>Soon he was counting men by the area. There were a couple hundred poles up front &#2013; enough to do serious damage to his contingent of calvary. The curtain wall was thick with archers, but the Rothian&#8217;s main forces — some five hundred infantrymen and a smattering of horses — were pushing forward.</p>

      <p>Quizzical. Why, he wondered, would they risk their men now? Surely the logical tactic would be to stay defensive, inside range, to await the onslaught. Did they not fear him? Did they not yet know that they were defeated?</p>

      <p>He spurred his mount again, driving her faster, when he saw a small group of what appeared to be five men charging forward. Yes, five. The foremost, about fifty yards away bore a lance.</p>

      <p>Korvas smiled wide. He was going to have a joust! And if he wasn&#8217;t mistaken, he was going head to head with a woman.</p>

      <p>At fifty paces, he bit down on his tongue, and spat blood into the air in front of him, which splattered his face in dark red. He rose to his feet in his stirrups, gripped the reins, and drew his long black blade from the scabbard on his back, pointing it skyward.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Princess' Cry</p>

      <p>Sienna, for her part, tried to remember her father&#8217;s teachings about wielding the joust. She leaned down towards Willow&#8217;s thick neck. She gripped the heavy lance and extended it towards her opponent. She looped the handle into her leather belt around her waist. She couldn&#8217;t remember if that was a good idea or not, but it helped steady the long and awkwardly heavy weapon. In essence, she braced herself. She was terrified that she would strike or harm Aila, whom she was gazing at.</p>

      <p>For a brief instant she saw herself through Aila&#8217;s eyes. She felt the unicorn&#8217;s awareness awakening from a deep slumber. Aila&#8217;s despair had given way to carelessness. But now something broke through the indifference. Curiosity struck first, followed by excitement: this furious warrior bearing down on her was Sienna, coming for her!</p>

      <p>Willow leapt gingerly over an overturned wagon, and the landing returned Sienna to her own thoughts. Overwhelmed, she cried out, &#8220;I am Sienna! Princess of Rothelyn! I am coming for you!&#8221;</p>


      <p>The Final Gambit</p>

      <p>At 20 paces, standing tall in his stirrups, his left hand gripping the horse&#8217;s mane, his right hand waving his long black sword in grand circles above his head, Korvas heard the woman&#8217;s cry and laughed.</p>

      <p>At 10 paces, he slowed his sword with his arm stretched back, timing his swing. He nudged his mount to the right, plotting a collision course with the lancer. This would force her to her left and weaken her angle of attack.</p>

      <p>At 5 paces, he stopped laughing. Subconsciously, he held his breath. He trained his eyes on the tip of his opponent&#8217;s lance. He had trained his whole life for moments like these. But he could not have prepared for what happened next.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Surprise</p>

      <p>Aila stopped.</p>

      <p>She planted her front hooves in the soil and braced her forelegs. Momentum carried her forward and lifted her rear legs off the ground. She slid forward several paces.</p>

      <p>In more ways than one, she had awaken from a dream. Watching herself through the princesses' eyes as she bore down on them had roused her spirit. She recalled the time when she had first seen her whole self. It was in the mirror-side of the portal, when she had first come to this terrific and horrific land. She recalled the image of her tall and slender form, white, glowing pink, and happy. She had been happy then, despite the feelings of trepidation and concern that had consumed her attention at the time.</p>

      <p>But now, looking at herself through the Sienna&#8217;s eyes, her ragged black and red appearance was striking, fierce, and she terrified herself. So much so that she stopped.</p>

      <p>Korvas launched from her back. Horses collided with her from behind, and ran past her on both sides. It created a jumbled up mess.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Lance</p>

      <p>At two paces, King Korvas Kell found himself hurtling through the air towards the ground, discombobulated and powerless.</p>

      <p>Princess Sienna&#8217;s lance angled towards him mid-air, but he fell to the ground and was behind her long before she could pin him.</p>

      <p>Willow continued to rush forward, into the fray. Aila was on her side, struggling to get up as they raced by. Two other panicking horses and one contorted man entangled her, and the unicorn struggled to rise and free herself.</p>

      <p>Sienna&#8217;s lance found the body of an approaching Kell, and she was thrown backwards from her horse. She landed hard on her back, but smiled to herself as it dawned on her that no, it was not a good idea to have secured the lance to her waist.</p>

      <p>Willow plowed through the oncoming horsemen. He held his head down, and ran. He knew Sienna had fallen. He had to turn around, but that meant that he had to get though the ranks, first. Halfway in, he plowed into the side of a horse and sent it careening into two others and finally the ground. He didn&#8217;t like that. But he had to keep going. Finally he broke free. He stopped running for a moment, as he turned about.</p>

      <p>That&#8217;s when he saw Talmund, and then Jivan.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Duel</p>

      <p>Aden watched Korvas fall. He watched, bemused, as Sienna broke into the mass of the oncoming horsemen. Time slowed, and he watched Korvas lay facedown on the ground. Where Aila stopped, the flow of horses split to each side, and Korvas lay protected. breathing.</p>

      <p>He pulled back on his reins and signaled to his men behind him as he slowed and dismounted his horse.</p>

      <p>Kellians and Rothians collided on both sides. But here it was calm.</p>

      <p>Aden walked cautiously to Korvas, his sword guiding the way. He reached the body and nudged the gauntleted arm with his foot.</p>

      <p>The gauntleted hand nudged back. Incredibly fast, Korvas latched onto Aden&#8217;s calf and jerked violently with a twisting motion, taking Aden to the ground. Korvas spun to his feet and in an impossibly graceful motion, thrust his sword down at the prince. But Aden deflected, rolled, and was soon parrying Korvas' second attack, this time on equal footing.</p>

      <p>Aden&#8217;s men dismounted and circled up castle-side. They stood motionless with their swords planted at their feet as they watched. Never had they seen Aden matched.</p>

      <p>Soon the Kells had rounded up to the west. Many of their number held shields, but they stood motionless and completed the circle to witness the fight.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Circle</p>

      <p>Aila broke free and rose to her feet. She pushed through towards the castle. In front of her were men standing with their backs to her, their horses waiting. She stood behind two rows of the Kells that formed the circle. And with them she watched as two young men in metal spun and slashed their long metal knives at each other.</p>

      <p>&#8230;</p>

      <p>Sienna swung her sword three times at three different men as she made her way towards where she had last seen Aila. She was not tall enough to see through the horses and men, and it was confusing and loud and dirty and sweaty and slow and fast and terrifying. She fought her way forward and she almost died three times. But she didn&#8217;t die. She did find Aila, but when she tried to get to her, the Kells pushed her back away from the circle, and she decided to try to find another way around.</p>

      <p>&#8230;</p>

      <p>Jivan and Talmund exchanged perplexed glances, for the first time with something other than the princess as the focus. Her horse, fit for battle, approached them cautiously.</p>

      <p>Jivan motioned to Talmund towards the horse.</p>

      <p>Talmund winced, and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re the better rider. You should go. Find Sienna. Find Aila.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Jivan nodded. Seconds later he was astride Willow. He turned the great beast around and the pair charged back towards the keep, singular of mind.</p>

      <p>Talmund, for his part, rose and patted the dirt from his pants. He gripped his sword and walked intently into the fray.</p>

      <p>The Battle&#8217;s End</p>

      <p>I told you I wouldn&#8217;t go into detail about this battle outside the gates of Rothmew, but here we are in the midst of it. I&#8217;ve told you about the deeds of Sienna and Willow, and of Jivan and Talmund, King Reginald and his men, Thedlin and Vots. Even Bee. Here I&#8217;ll not tarry, for if you could foresee how events played out&#8230; No, I&#8217;ll not tarry.</p>

      <p>The King rode to the south, clashing with the Kells there, and Thedlin engaged those to the north. Vots remained near the curtain gates, commanding a contingent of archers and spearmen. These were warriors, yes, but more than that they were craftsmen, potters, smiths, horse handlers, cooks, and tradesmen, all standing in line to protect their home from invaders. Each fought with the determination of many.</p>

      <p>Aden and Korvas fought for ages &#2013; through spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and back again &#2013; in the calm center of the battle. Both took minor wounds, and each moved through phases of tactics, frustration, fear, and rage. Near the end, Korvas parried a swift thrust, drew his dagger, and thrust it upwards to Aden&#8217;s neck. Aden countered defensively, pinning his left arm against his opponent&#8217;s dagger arm. Then with a twist of his wrist, he thrust his sword deep into Korvas' armpit. With a kick, he hurled the Kellian to the ground. Instinctually he felt his neck which was gently oozing warm blood down his throat, through his chainmail, to his chest.</p>

      <p>Korvas scurried away in the mud away from his pain. It was immeasurable, and he panicked. He rose to his feet, and wobbled towards his men to the west. His soldiers parted to make way for his retreat. But for the second time that day, Korvas was taken by surprise by he steed. For Aila, the black and red unicorn, stood blocking his path. She lowered her horn towards him.</p>

      <p>He fell not by her horn. Aden swung furiously at him from behind and took his head off. It was an impossibly swift motion. The sharpness of his blade left no mark. For several seconds, his head stayed perched to his neck. It slid off with a frozen look of amazement. Aila and his black-clad men watched in shock.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Oath</p>

      <p>Jivan and Willow pushed through the battle, disrupting clashes of fighting men as their way was hindered. Willow pushed through men in his path indiscriminately. They fell beneath his bulk and were trampled as often as not. Meanwhile Jivan kicked to one side or the other, and he swung his sword in wide arcs defensively and offensively both.</p>

      <p>The field was a maze of explosive sounds and engagements, the battle was swaying to one sides favor and fro. Willow felt the ardent rage and fear surrounding him. He was glad for his halter and Jivan&#8217;s directional assistance, for without it he would be lost.</p>

      <p>Jivan drove Willow towards his singular objective. As he forged onward, towards the center of the battlefield, his pledge to the princess repeated in his head.</p>

      <p>&#8216;By my sword, by the king, and by my word, I will find her and return her to you.&#8217;</p>

      <p>&#8216;By my word, I will find her and return her to you.&#8217;</p>

      <p>&#8216;I will find her.&#8217;</p>

      <p>&#8216;I will find her.&#8217;</p>

      <p>&#8216;I will find her.&#8217;</p>

      <p>And then there was silence. Echoes of his inner voice faded out and his procession of chanting thoughts ceased.</p>

      <p>He found her.</p>

      <p>He spurred Willow forward, and moments later they were within throwing distance. Jivan found a clearing nearby where the men were packed less tightly, and he dismounted. He turned Willow towards the Keep, and whispered to him.</p>

      <p>&#8216;Run boy. Don&#8217;t stop. She&#8217;ll need you soon.&#8217;</p>

      <p>Willow darted, plowing through men he couldn&#8217;t avoid. And he was happy with his charge, though he feared for Sienna.</p>

      <p>Jivan fought the Kells he couldn&#8217;t avoid. He killed three before reaching the Unicorn. For a moment he relaxed in the relief of completing his mission. A moment only. He edged in beside her as several revelations unfolded before him.</p>

      <p>First, he observed that he was on the outer circumference of a cleared circle that was quickly collapsing. Odd.</p>

      <p>Second, he saw immediately before him the head of Korvas Kell fall from his body, and the prince, Aden, the evident cause. They must have fought, and the men surrounding must have made way.</p>

      <p>Third, before he could process what was happening, he watched as a Kell soldier in black pushed his crudely crafted sword deeper and deeper into the unicorn&#8217;s muscular neck.</p>

      <p>Jivan&#8217;s mouth and eyes gaped open. He brought his sword down and cleaved the arms from the body of the loathsome Kell. He tossed his sword to his off hand, grabbed the hilt of the sword in Aila&#8217;s neck, and withdrew it as she fell. He then plunged the Kellian blade into the throat of his now handless foe and quieted his screams.</p>

      <p>Immediately he thrust his sword into the ground and fell to Aila&#8217;s side. He put his hands over the gash in her throat. Blood flooded out between his fingers with each softening beat of her heart.</p>

      <p>The moment finally passed. He had found her.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Fall</p>

      <p>King Reginald broke through into the circular clearing and watched as Aila fell.</p>

      <p>&#8216;Aila! No!&#8217; He bellowed.</p>

      <p>Soon he was at her side.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Last Stride</p>

      <p>Talmund was working his way through the battle avoiding what fights he could, and parrying the blows he couldn&#8217;t avoid. He took a sword to the shoulder, and a glancing blade swiped down his forehead and cheek. Blood ran down the side of his face but he didn&#8217;t notice or stop. He hated this. He hated the Kells for attacking him, and he hated that to find Sienna he had to kill. He hated killing.</p>

      <p>Ahead, he saw Willow charging forcefully through the swordsmen on the ground, riderless. Why? Had Jivan fallen? He picked up his pace and hurried to where Willow had been. Instead of Jivan, he saw Sienna, stumbling backwards from a giant ogre of a man armed with a massive tree branch tipped with long black iron blades. He swung his improvised maced back and over his head and growled like a grizzly as he stepped towards Sienna, who was now struggling to get up from a sitting position.</p>

      <p>Talmund propelled himself towards the scene. His last stride was a desperate leap, and as he fell to the ground between the two players he plunged his sword into the giant&#8217;s exposed belly. It interrupted the Kellian&#8217;s killing blow, but the brute appeared unfazed. He took a step back and let out an agonized bellow. His branch weapon remained high above his head, and he drove it down, crushing deep into Talmund&#8217;s back. Talmund crumpled flat to the ground. He let out a gasp of air and was still.</p>

      <p>When the giant managed to dislodge his mace from Talmund&#8217;s back, he hefted it up to the sky again. That motion twisted the longswords out of his abdomen, and with it a large portion of his innards. He collapsed forwards, landing on Talmund&#8217;s prone body, and writhed in agony.</p>

      <p>Sienna&#8217;s slim sword ended his pain as it slid in and out of his massive neck. She then gasped, dropped her sword, and clutched her own throat with both hands. Her body stopped supporting her, and she dropped to her knees. She gasped for air as her head hit the ground. At the same time, she heard though the clamor of battle her father&#8217;s voice yelling Aila&#8217;s name.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Horn&#8217;s Command</p>

      <p>Jivan&#8217;s hands were red and warm. They were sore from the constant pressure he applied to Aila&#8217;s wound. His knees were wet from the pool of blood he knelt in. A cacophony of battle sounds surrounded him, but all he could hear was Aila&#8217;s diminishing heartbeat. He was dimly aware of the king at his side. He was dimly aware of the king&#8217;s guard driving back the enemy from the area. He was dimly aware of the three long blasts of a horn. But he was unaware of its significance.</p>

      <p>The black armored men knew the signal for retreat. When the horn began the third blast, they turned en masse and fled to the west. The Rothian calvary gave chase, and they drove the Kells into the western foothills. Many arrows were loosed, and many bodies marked the retreating army&#8217;s wake.</p>

      <p>Reginald put his head and hands to Aila&#8217;s neck and silently cried. If you were there, and if you were paying attention, you would have noticed the faint pink glow from a seven-sided star illuminating the space between the king and the unicorn.</p>

      <p>Thedlin rode up and dismounted. He put his hand on Reginald&#8217;s shoulder and said, &#8216;My lord, she has left us. Let her go.&#8217;</p>

      <p>Reginald looked up to the familiar voice. He felt like a child, and heard Thed&#8217;s voice as that of his seven year old companion. His friend who had always been the wiser, more assured. His reverie took him to memories he had long ago locked away. When they had run off to the woods with their new bows, and killed rabbits and cried together. When they had fallen in love with the same young countess and fought in the stables until they were both bruised and exhaust to the point of tears and laughter. When they had ridden to the north for weeks to see how far they could dare each other to ride on. When Thedlin had fallen for the eccentric country peasant girl, and grew distant and severe. That had crushed Reginald, but in time he grew to trust that Thedlin would be at his side at every critical moment. He was there when Regingal lost his first love in childbirth. On blood soaked sheets, Leana had delivered a lifeless child and too much of her blood. After three days of mourning, Thed came to him and said these same words for the first time. &#8216;My lord, she has left us. Let her go.&#8217;</p>

      <p>Reginald looked up from his despair at his old friend in anguish. He shook his head. Time passed.</p>

      <p>Jivan interrupted the moment, yelling at those nearby. &#8220;Do something!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Not this time, Thed.&#8221; The king replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. Try to understand. Try to forgive me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Nallo?&#8221; Asked Thedlin, perplexed by the cold shiver that went through his body.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It has to be you. Tell Sienna. She will understand. She knows that I love her. The letter&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <p>Thedlin, confused, and Jivan, panicked, watched powerlessly as Reginald gently touched Aila&#8217;s horn. Where his fingers made contact with the bone, an unmissable pink glow followed. He stroked the long, grey, twisted spike with the back of his hand until it reached the tip and then hovered in the thin air above. After a brief pause, the king closed his eyes and pushed the palm of his hand down on the horn. There was a bright pink explosion of light. When it expired, the king&#8217;s empty body lay supine on the ground beside an awakening unicorn.</p>

      <p>If you were paying close attention you would have noticed a fading pink light extinguish from a seven-pointed star on the center of his palm.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Clouds</p>

      <p>Jivan&#8217;s hands, though numb from pressure, felt strong palpitating heartbeats and additional strange movements. They grew warmer and warmer, and when he couldn&#8217;t tolerate the heat he retracted them and watched as the wound closed, leaving pure white hair in its stead. He climbed to his feet as Aila did the same, and momentarily the two stood side by side.</p>

      <p>As Aila rose, she shook her head vigorously. Black tar and blood red paint flew from her face. Her shaking moved down her neck and mane, through her shoulder and down her back. She shook down her hind quarters and gave each leg a shake. At each shiver, bleakness flung from her body, and as it landed on the ground, it sizzled and steamed into the mud. Black holes sunk into the earth and a retched stench emanated from each.</p>

      <p>It was a sight to behold, I tell you. Men in all directions stopped to gape in wonder as the white unicorn emerged from the shadowy black beast.</p>

      <p>At last, the straps that bound her wings to her body dissolved away, and as she stretched out her magnificent wings, the blackness fell away and was replaced with a bright pink glow.</p>

      <p>She let out a terrific neigh, a powerful cry to the heavenly body Ilo. And with that cry, she rose high on her hind legs and flew into the sky. Her thoughts were mute. Her eyes saw nothing. Her throat was hoarse, her mouth was parched; that was all she knew.</p>

      <p>Her first conscious thought was that she would like a drink from a cloud.</p>

      <p>She liked clouds.</p>
